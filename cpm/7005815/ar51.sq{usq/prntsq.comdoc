Re:   PRINTSQ

"PRINTSQ.COM" is a version of TYPE15, which I rewrote for
printout to the LST: device.  I did that on request from
someone who wanted to print out STARTREK.PQC, but only
has 90k room on a disk - not enough to hold the unsqueezed
file.  Thought it might be useful to someone else, so I
left it here....
