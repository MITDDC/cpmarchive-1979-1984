Sounds like a job for "Superman" (otherwise known as MTN 3.0)...

Re:   CP/M <-> ARPAnet transfers

Keith -
	What exists on MIT-MC is great for us technical types who feel
comfortable with assemblers and debuggers.  However, there are a lot
of people out there who feel happy that they know how to use WordStar.
They want to use their machines locally, sending files off to be
printed or to check their mail.  They want a menu driven program that
does not have to be assembled or patched to be used.  A good example
is the modem2 program for the IBM PC that utilizes function keys and
does not require setting up MODEM on the remote end to send/receive.
Everything can be done by touching a key on the local machine.  What I
am doing is esentially putting a "marketing" layer on top of existing
"product", ie. making the modem2 program more accessible to
non-sophisticated users for use in the ARPAnet community.  I will be
driven by the requests of potential users for a package for their
particular system.  The problem of distribution can be handled by
mailing a floppy, if necessary. I understand your concern that effort
not be needlessly duplicated.  However, the person who got me involved
on this project did so at the request of ARPA higher-ups who wanted
the CP/M machines able to communicate with the net via file transfer.
The fact that they didn't know about MC was the basis for my comment
on not reaching all interested users. The range of computer ability is
widening incredibly, from the large number of first-time users who
have been led to believe one must be a genius to use a computer, to
the geniuses who are trying to make it easier for them via standards,
portability, and intelligent software.  Unfortunately, the large
amount of work that must go into making a highly technical project
work is often unmatched by the perhaps even greater effort needed to
make it usable by the "masses".

	I hope I have cleared up what it is I am attempting to do.
I have personally profited from the MIT-MC setup, although I have had
some difficulties in assembling some of the software (particularly the
modem.221asm which seems to have undefined symbols).  Even so, once I
had gotten the modem program running on a dial-up to ISI, I still had
problems running it either way through a TAC.  I have to get this
solved before doing much else.  I would like to be able to send off a
program virtually guaranteed to work thru TIPs, TACs, dial-ups ,
Ascii/binary, etc.  Thanks for your concern and help.

Subject:  MTN 2.2A DCHayes Bug Fix
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC
cc: INFO-MTN at MIT-MC

With the help of Ron Fowler (RGF@MC), we tracked down the bug using an
old listing of MTN 2.1.  (My listing and disk for MTN 2.2A are
apparently permanently and irretrievably archived...)  I have just now
found a machine with a DCHayes modem in it and tested the following
patch - and it worked!  With this patch installed in a copy of the
uncustomized MTN22A.COM, REName it to MTN22B.COM.  My apologies to all
for not finding and fixing this rather elusive bug much sooner...

This patch will prevent a reentered MTN from hanging up the phone when
there is a carrier already present:

21B4 -> 3E A5 00 (LD A,0A5H)
27ED -> 42 ("B")

For those who still have 2.2, this upgrades it to 2.2A:

2.2 -> 2.2A  11E4 to 11E7 -> 00
