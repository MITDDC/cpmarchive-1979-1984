     For  the  past  several  months,  I've been researching the
market in an attempt to	find the all-time  hot	set-up	modem to
use with my own	CBBS-RCP/M system.  I've finally made my choice,
and  perhaps some of my	thoughts and observations will help  you
make yours.  

     To	 get  a	bulletin board or remote file transfer system on
the air, you need  more	than just a simple acoustic coupler such
as the widely-used Novation CAT.  As a minimum,	you need a modem
which can automatically	 answer	 the  telephone,  run  in either
answer	 or   originate	  mode,	 and  offer  a	high  degree  of
sensitivity, selectivity, and  immunity	 to  both electrical and
acoustic  noise.    Although  auto-originate is	nice,  it  isn't
necessary for a	bulletin board system since its	primary	function
is to answer calls, not	originate  them.   But since most people
who implement a	bulletin board or RCP/M	system	also  use  other
systems,  the  added  flexibility  offered  by an auto-originate
modem is worth paying a	little more for.  

     The requirement that the modem should be capable of running
in either answer or originate mode may not be obvious, but it is
important.    Normally,	 a caller dials	up a bulletin  board  in
originate mode,	and the	bulletin  board	 answers in answer mode.
For the	unitiated, the originate/answer	terms refer primarily to
the various tones that are used	to transmit and	receive	data.  A
binary	1  (or "mark") is transmitted at one  frequency,  and  a
binary 0 (or  "space")	is  transmitted	 at  another  frequency,
(usually lower in pitch	then the mark tone).  The difference  in
frequency  between  the	mark tone and the space	tone is	referred
to  as	the  frequency	shift,	or  just  "shift".    Ham  radio
enthusiasts will recognize  the	 mark, space, and shift	terms as
being hang-overs from teletype terminology.  

     In	 addition to having a difference  in  frequency	 between
mark and space,	 there is also a difference in frequency between
answer and originate.	 Typically,  an	 answer	modem's	mark and
space  tones  are  about  1  KHz  higher  in frequency	than  an
originate  modem's  tones, but both still use  a  common  shift.
With Bell 103 type modems, the answer modem marks at 2225 Hz and
spaces at 2025 Hz (a  shift  of	 200  Hz).   The originate modem
marks at 1270 Hz and spaces at 1070 Hz (again,	a  shift  of 200
Hz).  In practice, the answer modem transmits at 2225/2025,  and
listens	 at  1270/1070 Hz, with	the originate modem transmitting
at 1270/1070,  and  listening  at 2225/2025 Hz.	 In this manner,
both modems can	talk at	the same  time	since  each  ignores the
tones  its  transmits,	and  only  recognizes  the  tones  being
transmitted  by	 the  other  end.    This  is  referred	 to as a
full-duplex  system  because  communication  is	possible in both
directions simultaneously.  There is nothing particularly  magic
about  the  Bell  103 tones, although they were	chosen with some
thought	as to the characteristics of the telephone network.  But
other frequencies and  shifts  can and are used	by other modems,
Other frequency	and shift combinations are possible, and in fact
are used on non-Bell 103 type modems, particularly those capable
of running at 1200 baud.  But remember	that  a	 modem using the
Bell  103  type	 tones	can only communicate with another  modem
using  the  same tones.	 A  Bell  103  modem  can't  talk  to  a
Racal-Vadic 1200 baud job, at any baud rate.  

     Okay, enough  terminology.	   What	 difference does it make
whether	my modem transmits in originate	or  answer  mode as long
as  the	 guy  on the other end is using	the complementary  mode?
Assuming that you  have	 a  good  connection,  it really doesn't
matter.	   But	on  a  noisy telephone line, the frequencies  do
matter,	since certain types of spikes and garbage may affect one
tone pair more than the	other.	There are those	who contend that
the high tones are more	 immune	to noise than the low tones, and
there are those	who contend  the  opposite.    I contend that it
depends	on the type of noise being encountered,	but it is a fact
that  you  can	sometimes  salvage  a bad connection  by  simply
swapping tones.	 That is, let the answer  modem	go to originate,
and let	the originate modem go to answer.   If the data	is being
transferred primarily in one direction only, such as when XMODEM
is sending a file, and infrequently listening  for  a  handshake
character, "flipping" tones may	make all the difference	 in  the
world.	However, if data is being transferred in both directions
equally	 often,	 flipping tones	probably won't help since you're
just transferring the hits from	one end	to the other.  

     So	we see that  the ability to change tones in midstream is
important.  It should  be  obvious  as	well that if you have an
answer-only modem, you can't use it to dial-up	another	bulletin
board or time-sharing system, since the	other end  will	be using
the answer tones when it picks up the phone.  

     What other	desirables are there to	consider before	buying a
modem?	 Well selectivity and sensitivity are very important  in
that they  allow  you're  modem	 to  communicate  on  a	marginal
telephone  line.    In	this respect, all modems are not created
equal.	A modem	featuring high selectivity usually has some sort
of crystal-controlled filtering	system to allow	it to zero in on
the precise mark and space  tones  its	listening  for,	 and  to
ignore	other  garbage	on  the	 line.	High selectivity is very
important in an	acoustically-coupled modem because the modem may
pick up	ambient	room noise along with the tones.  With a popular
low-priced modem I've played with,  I  can  raise  all	kinds of
havoc  by having my stereo going at the	same time I'm trying  to
transfer  data.	   The	reason	is  that if the	music contains a
frequency close	to the frequency of the	mark or	space tones, the
modem will get confused	unless it really  notches out everything
except the tones its looking for.  With	a direct-connect  modem,
you  avoid  the	 problem  of room noise, but noise, ringing, and
echoes on the line still make high-selectivity very desirable in
either type of modem.  

     Sensitivity is also a big deal, since it determines how low
a signal level you're modem  can work.	A highly-sensitive modem
can pull a signal out of the mud  where	 a  less-sensitive modem
would  either fail to hear anything at all, or	at  least  would
plague you  with  drop-outs  everytime a little	pop ambled by on
the line.  As with selectivity,	 sensitivity  is  more important
with  an  acoustically-coupled	modem than with	a direct-connect
modem  simply because the direct-connect  modem	 won't	have  to
listen for the tones through any room noise it might pick up.  

     Both sensitivity and selectivity have to do with how well a
modem will  receive  data.    But  when	 transmitting  data, the
frequency  stability  of the tones being generated is important.
You  don't want	a tone oscillator  that	 drifts	 off  frequency,
especially  if	the  other  guy	is using a modem with very sharp
filtering  ("high selectivity").    The	 best  modems  currently
available  at  hobbyists  prices  all  use  crystal-  controlled
oscillators  to	 generate  the	tones,	and  since  this type of
circuitry  is  cheap to	design and manufacture,	stability  isn't
much of	a problem with all but the cheapest of modems.	However,
an acoustically-  coupled  modem can get fouled	by the telephone
microphone element.  The tones	could  be generated by the modem
right on frequency, but	if the carbon microphone element used in
most  handsets has packed down,	the tone  could	 be  transmitted
down  the   telephone	line  either  distorted	 or  shifted  in
frequency.  Replacement	microphone  elements are available, such
as the Novation	Super Mike, which are  superior	 to the	elements
used  by  Ma Bell.  I can testify from personal	experience  that
the Novation  element  does work and has frequently made all the
difference in the world	 on some connections.  If you go with an
acoustic modem,	no matter  how	good  it  is, I	would definitely
recommend that you install a Super Mike	as standard equipment on
your modem telephone.  Its a ten buck miracle.	

     From the previous discussion, you may  get	 the  impression
that  a	 direct-  connect  modem  is  definitely superior to  an
acoustically-coupled job.  Theoretically, this line of reasoning
is correct.  In	actual practice	however,  change "definitely" to
"maybe".  My arsenal of	computer equipment  presently includes a
Datec  32  originate/answer acoustic modem, and	 I  can't  speak
highly enough  of  it.	 Its ugly as sin and bulky as bulldozer.
When the handset is inserted  in the coupler, you have to strain
your neck to see the receive-data and carrier-detect lights, and
it takes too long to acquire carrier-detect.  But when the going
gets tough and a lot of	other highly-touted  modems are	ready to
throw in the towel, Datec just hums right along.    With a Super
Mike-equipped  handset,	 the  Datec  is	 a  damn  fine piece  of
equipment.   Hobbyists seldom use them,	but professionals  swear
by  the	 entire	  line	 of   Datecs.	 If  you  want	a  basic
originate/answer modem with performance	 second-to-none, and you
don't need all the fancy auto this and auto  that,  the	Datec 32
and a Novation Super Mike is what you want.  

     Why this testimonial about	a bare-bones acoustic modem when
we're  talking	about  super-modems?	Simply	this:  the Datec
acoustic  can outperform some of the best direct-connect  modems
on the market  today  including	 the  CATs, U.S. Robotics, D. C.
Hayes  Micromodem  100,	 Microconnection,  and	several	 of  the
high-priced  Racal-Vadics (all	Bell  103-compatible).	  In  my
opinion, you're	 going to have to spend	a big (as in BIG) wad of
money	to  get	 a  Penril   or	  some	 other	 top-of-the-line
"professional-quality"	modem  that  will work any better at the
basic level than my Datec.  So don't let anybody tell you that a
direct-connect	  modem	   will	   "always"    outperform     an
acoustically-coupled  modem.	If  all	 other factors and basic
specifications are the same, a direct- connect	modem  WILL do a
better	job.	But  a	well-designed  acoustic	coupler	will run
circles	 around	 a  poorly-designed direct-connect  modem  every
time.  

     A	companion  article  may	 be  available	on  this  system
reviewing a newcomer  to  the direct-connect super modem market,
the D. C. Hayes	Smartmodem.    Anyone thinking of using	this new
product	on a CBBS or RCP/M type	 system	 should	read this review
before making your purchase.
