LCAT is designed to concatenate existing .REL files into a
searchable library as required by LINK.  FOR creates such a
library from the modules included in the source file.  ASMB
can assemble only one module at a time.  .REL files created
by FOR and ASMB are suitable for LCAT, as is ASMLIB.  FORLIB
must have a 1A patched in behind the final 9E before any
attempt is made to append to it using LCAT.  LCAT assumes that
the byte sequence 9E 1A is always used for end of file.  It is
not known whether it is possible for this sequence to occur
within the bit data stream, but if this should happen, LCAT
will not be usable.  To guard against this possibility, it
would be necessary to make LCAT interpret the .REL file as LINK
does.
