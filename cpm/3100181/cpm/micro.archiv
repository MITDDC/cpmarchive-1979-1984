c
A while ago it was asked what purpose there is in owning a personal
computer.  (what are those fool things good for, anyway? or something like
that.)  I didn't see my particular reason in the responses, so I might
as well add it.

I am one of those people (there are many) who got into programming by
accident; I never intended to do it as a career but got completely swept
away by it.  As a result, I am one of those fortunate folks for whom my
job is not just a means to making money, but a means for doing what I
like as well.  Which is why I never had a question of what a personal
computer is good for - it is simply an end in itself.  It allows me
to follow up on some of those thoughts like: "boy I'd like to try to
write a type x program, but it ought to do THIS neat thing too...".

As for why the average person wants one, I see no reason why everyone can't
enjoy them in the same way that I do.  I don't feel the need to justify
mine economically (justify your snowmobile or boat or pool table or...).

	I thought only SUN made them.

	DO any of these 68000 based things (with unix) support floating point?


Cadlink claims to be working on an 8086/8087 board for their SUN board
system. Delivery date is "soon". This is intended to be a stopgap measure
until Motorola starts deliveries of their floating point chip (4Q83 ??).
Floating point for most of these systems is now done in software.

I'm sorry, but I agree with Pournelle.  He made a slight error in
saying that there are extra keys between the \space bar/ and the shift
key.  In any case, however, the shift keys and the Return key ARE
farther away than on the standard keyboard, and considering the
frequency with which these keys are used, that is quite sufficient to
ruin the whole keyboard, at least for touch typists who learned to
type on a normal keyboard.  Why IBM did this I don't know, since the
keyboards on their typewriters are excellent.  As for the PC
keyboard's good "feel," that can hardly compensate for the bad feeling
I get from typing the wrong characters because the keys are misplaced.

One reason for the poor graphics may be that computer professionals are
excellent computer people but, perhaps related to that reason, are not
particularly excellet writers.  I know some writers also, who want
nothing to do with computers, thus cannot write with knowledge about
them in a readable style.

	I agree, and concede the point. It doesn't HAVE to be this way.

	The thing that burns me is those of us in the academic computer
world who look upon computers as being `our' property. It's a pretty
snobbish attitude to try to exclude the rest of the world from computers
and computing devices just because they are complicated and the `average
user can't be expected to understand them.' The average user WON'T under-
stand, as long as the infamous jargon and other attempts by computerists
to keep the field to themselves exist.

	No, no, no. . .you misunderstand my point. There's no conspiracy
to keep computers away from the masses. It's just that a lot of computer
scientists have secret feelings (or job insecurities) which make them
feel as though they had to keep the technology to themselves, and to let
the public have only a watered-down, simplified version of their knowledge.
Thus, home computers become tax-computing, game-playing toys.

	It's good that you have such an attitude towards your profession.
Unfortunately I think that much of the reason for the lousy documentation
in personal computer software (and also the somewhat shallow software
available) is due to hidden fears on the part of some CS people.

   really, what makes you think this?  and are you really talking about
"computer scientists" (ie, academics & researchers), or more generally
"computer professionals" (programmers and engineers in the industry)?
can you point out an example of technology withheld from the public by
computer scientists or professionals for such venal reasons?
   i don't own a personal computer myself, because i have basically free
access to far more computer than i could hope to buy for my own.  i have
done a few personal applications, but nothing to brag about.  now, if i,
presumably clued in to the technology, can't dramatically apply it to my
own personal life, why should i assume that if novices can't either, it's
because info i have is being withheld from them?  i can agree with you that
most PCs are schlock, but not for the reasons you give.

   Here it is: I've got the June, 1982 issue of BYTE in front of
me; page 288.

	``. . .Only IBM has RUINED the keyboard! What ought to be its
	strongest point, the thing IBM always excelled at, is its worst
	mistake.
	   What IBM did was to put extra keys between the space bar and
	the Shift key. Why, I don't know. The result is that when you 
	think you've typed, say, a capital T, you get instead /t, which 
	isn't useful at all.
	   There is also no line-feed key; instead IBM seems to have
	manipulated the Carriage Return key to give both carriage return
	and line feed when struck. . .I suppose there's a way to filter
	that madness; but there's no help for the Shift key being
	mislocated, nor for the egregious amount of space between the home
	keys and the Return key.
	   I may one day buy an IBM--but not until I get over the shock
	of that ruined keyboard. I've never been so disappointed in my
	life.''

   There was no mention of the feel of the IBM PC keyboard anywhere in
the column. I'm not sure what he means by "extra characters between the
space bar and the Shift key;" the shift keys and the space bar are not
adjacent on any keyboard I've ever seen. I think what he really means
is the \ key, between the Z and the left shift key. Thus the "/t" he
mentions should really be "\t", which is what you'd get from not reaching
far enough for the left shift.

   My own personal comment, if I may: Right now I'm typing on an IBM 3101
terminal, which has the "<" key placed between the Z and the left shift,
and the return key is exactly the same distance from the ";" key (and thus
the rest of the home row for touch-typists) as on the IBM PC keyboard.
I find the 3101 a joy to use; the keyboard has an excellent feel and none
of the above complaints ever get in MY way. This opinion is shared by
many of the other users here at CSO--I'll take this over a VT100 any day.
I've only had a few minutes at an IBM PC, but from what I experienced, I'd
be quite happy with that, too. The keyboard remains the strong point of
IBM's design, despite what Jerry Pournelle says.

	The problem is in the software. Hardly any of the software
manufacturers for microcomputers make any attempt whatsoever to target
their software at the "average user." Most of the time, the documentation
is nonexistent, very poor, or aimed at someone who is knowledgeable in
the field of microcomputers. The programs that are available are mostly
games, granted, but there is a wide, untapped market. Home lighting
control and security, for example--with a phone interface, a speech
synthesizer, and a touch-tone decoder, the average person could easily
inquire about and control the status of his house from far away. This
sort of thing is simple--if only a company would take the time to make
the software and hardware as easy to install as, say, a washing machine.

	The problem is that everyone in the computer field thinks of
microcomputers in terms of computers. What can they do? Well, they can
crunch numbers, store vast amounts of data, communicate with a large
network, and can be excellent text processors. Fine. These are the
*ACADEMIC* uses of computers (micros being a subset). The *PERSONAL*
applications of computers are different; the audience is much different.
They don't care what the computer can do, what kind of microprocessor it
has, what kinds of networks it can connect to, or even how many floating-point
multiplies it can perform in a second. They are interested only in a machine
to make life easier and more entertaining for themselves. They want 
to be able to organize business records, keep notes, type out letters,
and so on. And those companies which first come out with programs that
the personal computer user really wants, well DOCUMENTED and EASY TO
USE and MEETING THE NEEDS of the home computer users, will be making a buck.

	There is an application out there for computers. The long worn
statement that computers can make anything easier is true. It's just
that the home applications have gone unnoticed for so long. They are
NOT the same as our ideas of computer applications, and the two sets
of needs will never meet. God help us if they ever do. But the want is
there nevertheless.

The people who read this mail via BBOARD is one problem that may be
solved by the BBOARD optional library for BABYL - but that is only
good where BABYL is available: TENEX, TOPS-20, and ITS.  The Unix
and other users are left out.

Digest tend to be large, but limited by some mailer restrictions on
most systems to about 15K.  Even still, that is a long time to hog on
a USENET connection chain, whereas alot of small messages tend to get
through quickly and also let other small msgs through as well - a more
equitable distribution.

So where are we?  Probably back to the state where the old INFO-MICRO
left us - digests and direct - and you know what happened to the
digest list...

Possible solution (if someone is *really* able to commit to daily
digest moderation): leave all the multi-drop users (BBOARDS and
USENET, etc.) on direct mail, and the rest who can use BABYL or some
equivalent undigestifying mechanism on the digest list.  How many does
that accomodate?

Thus, a survey: send me mail if you prefer a digest format and we'll
count them up and come to some arbitrary conclusion to see if it is
worth the effort.  Let's hold off further discussion until the numbers
are in.

Thanks,
Frank

It's really a two-faced problem.  One really doesn't want to choke the
Net with messges.  On the otherhand, there are definite reliability
problems with turning the list into a Digest.  Having a list in
digest form translates into continuing human intervention, not for weeks,
but for months, or even years.  Further, it is kind of annoying when
the mail to the list doesn't get digested at least every other day.  
When the digest goes out once a week or less, it kind of defeats the idea
of electronic mail.

Another problem with "digestion" is censorship.  All too often, messages
from people get "lost", either by accident or on purpose.  While I'm
not fond of receiving "blank" mail or 10 copies of a letter, I would
like to see all the stuff sent to a list, so that I can decided what I
want to read.

What I am trying to get at is that if Info-MICRO does go "digest", we
really need a moderator that is willing to play postman on a daily
basis.

An alternative idea is to have direct mailing to people who want it, and
a weekly digest for people who don't care one way or the other.

Keith, if you use the Emacs Babyl system to read bboards then digest format
is not a problem.

Digest format helps make net traffic more efficient (one large message as
opposed to many small ones), is usually less redundant, and topics for
discussion can be better defined.  I think we could get this out of a
digestified INFO-MICRO and not lose as long as the "intended" topics of
discussion for the bboard remain open-ended.  INFO-MICRO has acted very
successfully as a catch-all for random info tidbits about micros.  That is
something I would not like to see change.

If anyone would like to argue this point please reply to me, I guess we
should keep from cluttering up INFO-MICRO.  The consensus will be made
known if some conclusion is reached.

In response to NEVES@MIT-MC:

I disagree with a few points of your note.  While I am skeptical of Atari
dropping its 400 price by 50%, I would be delighted if they did.  It would
make it cheap enough for me to consider buying a second machine.  I already
have a 800 with all the goodies.

I consider the lack of a built-in language a PLUS!  Suppose I wanted to use
Microsoft Basic rather than Atari's (actually I prefer Atari's Basic), then
why should I pay for Atari's Basic?  What if I only want to use PILOT or
FORTH or C or PASCAL (no, I'm not that masochistic) or even just the assembly
language?

"This lack of emphasis {on computational capabilities} will result in lack
of software, lack of cheap floppies, and horrible keyboards."  I know Atari
will be pushing software for games rather than, say, text editors for the
the foreseeable future, but if you wanted to get rich and famous, would you
want to write a text editor for the Apple machines or for the Atari when there
are 20 times as many Ataris out there?  Wouldn't it be more profitable for
a hardware manufacturer to produce a floppy (or a hard disk) for Atari even
though only 20% of the Ataris have disk drives rather than for Apple?

(I grant it will be harder to separate the junk (poorly written/designed)
programs for the Atari from the good ones because there will be more programs.)

I believe that TI's price drop is out of desparation - the TI99 has been a
flop.  Last December's price drop for the Ataris and any future price drops
will probably come as a result of savings because of the quantity sold.

As for the keyboard:  An 800 keyboard can be attached to the 400.  I wouldn't
be too surprised if someone other than Atari starts supplying these.  (Atari
does NOT sell them but you can find some surplus ones.)
(For those who do not know, the 400 and 800 are computationally identical.
The differences include the keyboard, only one cartridge slot on the 400 (but
no one uses the second one on the 800), and the memory card and OS are harder
to get at on the 400.  There are some hardware products by other vendors that
require the memory slots that only the 800 has.  But the price difference is
about $600-$700.)

I think proper complaints about the Atari might include the fact that there is
no easy way to get at the bus, serial i/o is slower than parallel, and the
company's policy of charging so much for software (but so does everyone else).
I believe Atari sees their hardware products (VCS, 400, 800) as Gillette(?)
saw their razors.  You can afford to give them away if you make all your money
on what goes into them!

Run Babyl and use M-X Undigestify Babyl Message, which separates a
digest into individual messages.  Then you can read/delete them after

There is news of at least a couple of computer manufacturers slashing
their prices.  There was a story in several financial papers a few days
ago about how TI is going to reduce the price of the 44/a by $100 (to
$199 retail) starting in Sept.  In some info-atari mail it was rumored
that the Atari 400 will be reduced to $150 in a couple of weeks.

I have a gripe about all these soon-to-be-under-$200 machines.  I am
worried that more emphasis will be played on the video game playing
capabilities rather than computational capabilities.  This lack of
emphasis will result in lack of software, lack of cheap floppies, and
horrible keyboards.  

Look at the Atari 400 for example.  Fantastic graphics.
However, it clearly is oriented to games.  If one wanted to write
programs one has to buy a BASIC cartridge, cassette recorder, and has to
suffer with the flat keyboard that wasn't really meant for typing.

What should the real home computer have?  This is my list.  You may
disagree.

1.  Regular keyboard layout with keys that go up and down.  The VIC is
the only one that has this (I don't know anything about the Trash-80
color computer).

2.  Color (all the cheap computers have this)

3.  Built in language (i.e. BASIC).  Atari doesn't have this but it can
be purchased.

4.  Floppies.  I consider cassette tape to be inadequate for program
storage.  It is too slow and error prone.  The problem is that floppy
storage is still too expensive for the micros.  You're talking 500-600
bucks for that first floppy.

5.  Communication capabilities (ie. RS232 interface for a coupler).  I think
the Trash-80 system has it built in,  the VIC has a cheap addition one
can buy, TI 44/a has expensive addition as does the Atari 400.  There is
a cheap direct connect modem for $100 (Signalman -- it is battery
powered).

6.  Total system cost should be in the range of a stereo, i.e. under $600.

I would  !! NOT !! want INFO-MICRO done in a 'digest' format
because since it is so large, I can just not read the messages
that I am not interested in because of what the header says!

By the way, our system is done such that we get one copy of each of
the mailing lists (info-micro, info-cpm, info-apple, info-atari)
onto a different directory and then everybody that is interested in 
reading them uses the BBOARD program to read what ever mailing lists 
they want to.  The BBOARD program displays the header, who it is from,
and allows you to either read it or skip onto the ext msg.

Hello,
	I am getting ready to buy two ZX81 (w 16k Ram each) and I would like
to network them together.  I am planning on writting truely two player
'war games' with each player using one ZX81.  I have chosen the ZX81 for the
simple reason that at $80 for a kit and $50 for 16k Ram I can buy the two 
whole systems for only $260.  I was wondering if there were any other ZX81
owners out there in net land and if anyone had allready done the hardware to
hook two ZX81 up?

Wonderful! Someone else to share our problems! We also have a Cadlinc SUN
workstation, and we have noticed the same trouble as you have when using the
thing as a "terminal" -- it is very slow once it starts scrolling and the
character set does look very strange. The scroll problem really can't be
helped, as such. It stems from the fact that scrolling the screen requires you
to move about 100Kb of memory, or about 50,000 iterations of a loop to move the
screen memory.
  We've come up with several possible solutions to this problem, but they are
kind of on hold right now. One involves just erasing the screen everytime it
reaches the bottom margin, or perhaps moving the bottom half to the top half
and then erasing the bottom half, so that you have at least 1/2 of your
screen sitting around.
   Another alternative would be to use the smaller character set (the z1 set,or
a home-made version thereof) and then have a smaller window on the screen,
which would require moving less memory. This would eliminate the slow scroll,
but it out also kill your eyes in short order.
   I would be interested in hearing what software & documentation they sent
you. We might be able to arrange sharing some utilities and whatnot. Send
mail to "pur-ee!uiucdcs!grunwald" if you're interested.

Greetings!  I just received some information about a UNIX/System III
Multi-user configuration built around a machine called the Pixel 100/AP.     
This is what the system looks like:

	100/AP (sic) Supermicrocomputer (68K/8 Mhz)
	1 mByte 150ns dynamic RAM
	128k I/O processor memory
	40 mByte Winchester disk w/controller
	2 x 630k Diskette drives
	8 x Pixel terminals (!)
	8 x RS232 ports
	2 x parallel ports
	UNIX System III
	Choice of programming language (includes 'C', UCSD Pascal...)

(And the bottom line ...)	Price = $19,900.00

Well!  Has anyone heard of these folks?  Better still, does anyone
have any experience with this stuff?  To get 8 users on a UNIX
system for ~ $20K seems hard to believe.  Comments please - I'm in a
bit of a hurry!

Thanks in advance...

Anyone have any other nifty downloadable programs?  We don't
have any disks yet.

"Mattel Co., the giant toy maker, has been found guilty of infringing on
a patent controlled by Magnavox Co. by marketing an electronic game. 
U.S. District Court Judge George N. Leighton ruled in Chicago that
Mattel's Intellivision game was so similar to a Magnavox game called
Odyssey that the Odyssey patent was infringed.  James T. Williams,
lawyer for Magnavox, said that Magnavox obtained the license to produce
Odyssey from Sanders Associates of Nashua, N.H., owners of the patent.
 ....  Leighton issued a verbal opinion Thursday after an eight-day
hearing.  He said he would issue a written ruling later.

In regard to the conduct of Intertec, here is my experience.  I purchased
a Superbrain II recently to develop software for a tester on our production
floor which is controlled by a Superbrain.  To my surprise, the two 
machines are not compatible.  I was not told this by anyone even when I
told them the use of the new machine.  When I called Intertec, I was told
that they were too busy right now and they would call me back.  After four
hours they had not called.  I called back and was connected to a very 
obnoxious CS rep who was no help at all.  I spent two days and 8 phone
calls before I found someone at Intertec who was helpful.  I have used
the machine for approximately 4 months with no problems, but I would not
buy another because of the attitude of Intertec.

JCP claims that CP/M-86 is `one of 3 OSes available, the best is MS-DOS
however.'. Presumably he is referring to the 3 OSes as IBM PC DOS,
MS-DOS and UCSD. There is now a fourth alternative (at least).
You can buy a full UNIX reimplementation called Coherent for $500
from Mark Williams, Chicago, 312-472-6659.  That includes a C compiler,
a full sort utility, and an incredible range of other utilities
as well as editors, mail, nroff text formatter, assembler, debugger,
etc, etc. A real bargain on UNIX systems! Compare the cost to
MSDOS or UCSD or CPM with sort, compilers, etc, and you may agree.

	I'm looking for a version of C for a Z80-CP/M system.  I've used
Whitesmith's C and was not too impressed.  Compile times are long, the
executable files produced were very large and very slow.  And to make life
interesting, standard functions are renamed and redefined.  The price tag
(~600-700 dollars) scares me away also.
	I've heard some good things about BD Software C and am wondering
if anybody out there has had any experience with it and/or can tell me

68000 systems that use a second processor to handle page faults while the
first processor is in a very long memory wait can (or should) be able to
handle arbitrary page faults (i.e. there should be no reason why only
data or only program references would work).  The catch is that with the
dual processor scheme, there is nothing else you can do during a page
fault (except field interrupts -- provided the hardware allows the second
processor to handle interrupts when the first processor is stalled).
In particular, the first processor cannot run code for another process
since the paging stunt depends on that processor hanging in a memory cycle.

Depending on how independent the second processor is, you may be able to
get other useful work out of it when it isn't handling a page fault (I believe
that Apollo uses a second processor to handle the network and some graphics),
but in order to do this effectively it would need some memory of its own
(or else some very fast system memory).  The problem is that a 68000 is
basically a memory-limited machine (most internal clock cycles are used
for memory cycles), and are often faster than system memory (i.e. wait states
are required), so there isn't any extra bandwidth for a second processor
to run without drastically interfering with the first.

The limitation on page fault handling imposed by the second processor should
not be too big a problem on a single user system, although ambititous
UNIX users can easily generate several active processes (i.e. edit in
foreground with a compilation in the background), but would obviously have
a chilling effect on time sharing.

  The only system I've used that's equal to or better than Unix
is good, old Multics.  However, Honeywell seems to want to price
and un-support Multics out of existence - the USGS is getting rid
of three systems in the next three years because of various
Honeywell policies.

  We have a lot of software written in PL/1 for Multics (PL/1 is
to Multics as C is to Unix).  Hence, some desperate requests for
PL/1 compilers on Unix.

  Multics is an excellent program development environment (more
so than V7 Unix), and I would like to see this nifty environment
live on and expand.

  (Flame on):  Multics is a damn sight better documented
internally and externally than Unix - I've dealt with source code
on both systems.  Multics is also a lot more consistent than Unix
(Flame off).

  So - does anyone know of any plans to move Multics to any of
the latest micros?  Multics seems a natural for the Motorola
68010, NS 16032, or Intel iAPX 432.

Hello,

  Having recently purchased the F-10 printer (at a very reasonable cost), I
can vouch for it's high quality.  I have installed it under WS 3.0, and it 
works like a champ.  This is nice, seeing as how it's my thesis printer.

  The only gripe I have is that, while TEC does an outstanding job on
hardware, their documentation reads like a 1930 camera instruction book.
Even with an updated manual containing the various control codes, it is
very nearly impossible to decipher the meanings of the various sequences.
Handshaking (parallel version) is rough, and I still haven't figured how
to drive the blasted thing from the CP/M LST: device.  The BUSY line isn't
asserted except for during the time the printer is accepting the character
from the lines....which for some reason allows it to drop characters, maybe
during the rather slow carriage return.

  Gripes aside, for the cash outlay, you can't beat the product, especially
since WS has an INSTALL option that sets it up so you don't have to fool
with it.

Daniel J Blumenfeld's recent message to this list suggested an
interesting idea.

Given the profusion of S-100 boards on the market, Info-Micro could do
a very important service by organizing some sort of database about
each board, including questions similar to those in Dan's message.
Information might be kept on who had which boards, for those who did
not mind the information being publicly available, so that those who
had or were considering buying that particular board could correspond.
The database could be similar in form to the tree-structured
documentation used on the ITS systems (those who have used the
Info-Terms node of this tree will know what I'm talking about as it
applies to hardware recommendations---similar systems also run under
Twenex).

I remember a letter some months ago by someone who went through all
the ads for memory boards he could find, listing all sorts of useful
information.  Such an effort, and others like it, deserve to be
included somewhere where everyone can get at the informtion, as do
less inclusive information about particular boards that people have.

For this effort, we need a separate submission list, a set of
"standard" questions about any given board (plus any other information
that pertains only to a class of products such as memory, particular
types of disk interface boards, A/D/A boards, etc), a way to structure
the information (almost certainly we do not want to keep the letters
themselves, but only the salient points, keeping the letters elsewhere
maybe as a backup), and, most importantly, someone to do all of this.

Since I suggested this, the logical idea would be for me to do it.
Unfortunately, I will not have the time, and probably not the disk
space.  Is anyone else interested in a time-consuming job that would
be greatly appreciated by all those who are buying or will buy S-100
systems?  If so, I'd be more than happy to contribute some time at the
beginning to try to figure out what needs to be asked and how the
information might be structured.

If there are only a few people on Info-Micro who want to be bothered
with all this foolishness (after all, not all micros are S-100 by a
long shot!), I can certainly set up a \temporary/ discussion list
using an ITS as a home site, assuming that the list does not grow to
encompass a large percentage of Info-Micro (for that, we'd need a
person with some system responsibility here to justify the amount of
mail the list would entail, and wouldn't need the list anyway because
we could use Info-Micro directly).  (Anyone else on this list with some
\real/ responsibility on an ITS might prefer to do it themselves...)

Any takers?  Any comments?

I received a promotional copy of the EMMS newsletter (sorry, but I threw
out the envelope with the address on it by accident...).  It is a
newsletter devoted to electronic mail systems.  I enclose this article
on the F-10 printer, because I believe it is of interest to the community.
I can NOT vouch for any of it (except that it was sent to me via US
Snail).  Having seen the ads in question, I tend to buy the article as T.
I quote the article in it's verbose entirety (the author must be a frust-
rated novelist...).  Pages 9-10:

PRICE WAR IN DAISYWHEEL PRINTERS?

The May issue of BYTE magazine ran one of the most unique ads we've ever
seen.  It was from a company called Write Writer (Santa Monica, CA) and
was more of a defense than an ad.  Write Writer told the story of how it
was being maligned by the supposedly exclusive distributers of a
daisywheel printer, the Printmaster F-10, for making false claims about
pricing.  But let's begin at the beginning.

In the April BYTE, Write Writer ran an ad promoting the 40 cps F-10 at
the astonishingl low price of $1295., which is even less than what 20
cps daisywheels sell for.  The F-10 is manufactured by Tokyo Electronics
Inc. (TEC) of Japan and distributed in the U.S. by C. Itoh.  In turn, C.
Itoh sells the printer OEM to Leading Edge Products (Canton, MA), which
also sells OEM to retail stores with a suggested list price of about
$1,895.

Leading Edge's retail computer store customers have offered the F-10 for
as low as $1,495, but $1,295 is probably what it sells for to the
retailers.  So how could Write Writer sell it for $1,295?  Curious?  We
sure were and have cleared away enough of the smoke to find that there's
enough fire to ignite a burning price war in daisywheel printers.

TEC:  The story begins with TEC, a master in the art of daisywheel
printing.  TEC manufactures Radio Shack's daisywheel printer and the
Starwriter line carried by C. Itoh in the U.S.  Its new product is the
F-10, which weighing just 30 pounds, is plug-compatible with Qume,
Diablo, and NEC printers and stands a mere 6" high.

A low price is no great feat if the manufacturer cuts quality corners to
produce a device that can't stand up to the same load as the higher
priced daisywheels.  But it turns out that the Printmaster is quite a
different animal.

A source from the word processing industry has told EMMS that his firm
has tested the F-10 exhaustively by literally running it into the ground
and said that it matched Qume, Diablo and NEC in reliability, quality
and durability.  In our source's opinion, it is a great printer.

Write Writer vs. Leading Edge vs. C. Itoh:  Now, the reliabilty of the
printer doesn't have anything to do with Write Writer's price of $1,295
versus Leading Edge's suggested retail price of $1,895.  Is Write Writer
selling hot printers?  That is, of course, one explanation.  But it
doesn't seem to be the right one.

It turns out that the TEC will sell in large volumes, according to our
source, for $695 per unit. Write Writer apparently got a hold of units
sold in Japan for this price and is going direct to end users at $1,295,
a move that sent Leading Edge right over its own. 

Leading Edge immediately called C. Itoh, which made an unscheduled call
on Write Writer and began telling customers that the ad was a fake,
etc., and that Write Writer couldn't really be selling the F-10 for that
price.

This led to Write Writer's unique ad in the May issue, telling of C.
Itoh's visit and of Leading Edge's contest of Write Writer's claim.  At
base, then, the ad was really a counter to assure customers that Write
Writer is selling its units for $1,295.

The Coming Price War?  This, of course, isn't the end of the story.  Its
only just begun.  Major word processing companies are intensely
interested in a daisywheel printer that could be procured for $695 OEM,
especially since our sources have tested the device and found it
reliable. 

If this story holds true -- there are numerous twists and turns in this
funny business, especially when trying to unravel relationships like TEC
- C. Itoh - Leading Edge, etc. -- then there is a price war coming in
daisywheel printers that will be unlike any that the industry has ever
seen.

Keytronics (the company that manfactures the IBM PC keyboard) sells a number
of OEM versions of the keyboard.  The standard version sends out RS-422 Serial
ASCII data at 300 baud.  The PC version on the other hand, is described by
Keytronics as:  "30K baud Syncronous Serial Output with Up/Down codes and
Special Handshaking".  While I'm familiar with Syncronous serial links, and
I'm pretty sure that I understand what they mean by "Up/Down" codes, I'd like
to hear from some PC owners (who are familiar with the PC hardware docs)
about the keyboard interface.  Specifically, who generates the 30K baud
clock, the PC? or the Keyboard?  Is there some sort of line from the keyboard
to the PC to indicate RESET (I know that you have to press a few keys to
reset the PC).  Is the serial link RS-422, as on the ASCII OEM version?
Is there any special sort of handshaking, as Keytronics mentions, or are
they simply talking about the fact that they keyboard sends Up/Down codes
rather than ASCII.  Any info would be appreciated.

My understanding of P40 is that it is a longer persistant P4.  The
reason it is used is to reduce frame refresh frequency from 60 (the
minimum required by P4) to as low as 30 Hz.  The Xerox Star uses P40
at 38.75 Hz interlaced.  The Alto also uses P40.  It leaves a smear
when the screen changes dynamically.  The Alto is refreshed at 30
Hz. interlaced (namely 30 Hz. frames, 60 Hz. fields).

For text processing applications, I would think that 30Hz interlaced
of P40 is the absolute minimum.  At this speed, having white
characters on a black background is a must or you will get flicker.
I have played with the Alto a lot and it hasn't disturbed me much.
However for animated graphics, and even static graphics with a lot
of redisplay or when thin lines that are on the same field happen to
be close together (such as in crosshatches), 30 Hz. is too slow.

Some people claim that if refresh rates are increased slightly (e.g.
to 33 Hz. or the Star rate), then the improvement (other than
getting out of beat with fluorescent lighting) is drastic and thus
cost effective.  Could somebody out there elaborate on this?

Does anyone have any opinions on the relative merits of the different
voice synthesizers now on the market?  I am particularly interested
in the ones that are RS-232 interfaced, and have built in text-to-
phoneme conversion capability. (Of course I also want to directly
output phoneme codes somehow).

The three units that I'm aware of are the Type 'n Talk by Votrax,
the Echo-GP by Street Electronics, and the Intex-talker from
Intex Micro Systems.  Are there any others that I've missed?

I am particularly interested in the relative quality of the
text-to-speech algorithms used.  Are any of them more sophisticated
than any other? Or do they all sound as bad as the Votrax unit?

Please respond directly to me, and I will post a summary of anything
interesting I find out to the list.

	Regarding the previous article on differences between the 68000
and the 68010:  You should already know that the 68000 does not handle
instruction restart.  The only way you can implement a true Virtual
Memory architecture using the 68000 is to use two processors.  One
does the real work, and the other handles faults (if you have a page
fault, the second processor reads in the page for you, being very
careful not to fault itself, of course).  The second processor does
not have to be a 68000, but it's cleaner if it is (Apollo has taken
this approach, as have a few others).  The disadvantage here, of
course, is that the first processor can do nothing while the second
one is handling the exception.  You can optimize this a little,
but the code is very nasty (speaking from experience here).

	The 68010, then, needs no fancy hackery.  Like a PDP-11,
it can restart instructions.  Equipped with an MMU, you could handle
various forms of VM.  The SUN machine has an architecture which
lends itself nicely to dropping in a 68010 (pin-for-pin compatible
with the 68000, remember), and a little exception handling code,
and ending up with a much more powerful system.

	Seems like this has been explained before, somewhere.  I
can only hope the readers of this list are now enlightened.

While helping a friend select boards for his S-100 system, we realized the
difficulty in choosing one board over another.  Besides the problem of
catalog descriptions making even the worst board look great, the "trusted"
names in S-100 stuff (Godbout, Morrow, etc.) have to manufacture boards 
which are similar, but have "minor" differences (e.g. Morrow sells four
stock versions of Disk Jockeys:  Memory Mapped at E000, Memory Mapped at
F800, I/O Mapped, and DMA).

For starters, I'd like to conduct an S-100 Floppy Disk Controller survey.
If you own or use an S-100 system with a disk controller, I'd like to
know your experiences with it.  Here's the info that I'd like to collect:

1.  The Make, Model Number, and year of manufacture of the Disk Controller.
2.  Number of years that you've used the controller.
3.  Features that the board has that you like (or feel worth mentioning).
4.  Features that the board lacks which you wish it had.
5.  Reliability info:  Does the board run "forever", does it have a habit of
    dying, etc.
6.  Service record:  Number of hardware failures, and number of repairs.
7.  Software support:  CP/M included?  Ease of modifying BIOS.
8.  Documentation:  Good board documentation?  Good configuration/BIOS
    documentation?
9.  If you've had to deal with the manufacturer, are they helpful?
10. Any other info which you consider important.

If you wish to respond to this survey, please send your replies to
DAN@MIT-ML.  Please be terse (i.e. I don't need detailed hardware
descriptions of your board).  In a week or so, I'll crunch all the replies
and make the survey results available.  Individual replies will be
kept confidential (as usual).  I am especially interested in hearing
from people using the newer DMA controllers.  Please do NOT send info
about S-100 Hard Disk Controllers (yet).  I know that there are alot
of people out there who use S-100 Floppy Disk Controllers, so any info
would be greatly appreciated.

I've been looking for the CRT phosphor specs for type P40 phosphor, without
much luck. Supposedly, P40 is similar to P4 but with a slightly different
hue and different decay characteristics.  The info is probably in the
EIA CRT specs doc., but unfortunately, I don't have one (the doc costs
over $40).  I'd also like to know what phosphor is used on the Xerox Alto.
When I used one, I noticed that the screen seemed "whiter" than P4.

I just spoke to Brian Grams of D-G Electronics, the company offering
the Super 89 board, the 4mhz CPU board replacement for the Heathkit H89.

Its price is $829 for a board with 64K.  Additional sets of
64K, up to 256K, are $125 each.  There are sockets to allow
you to add your own, if you like.  In addition to all the other
goodies mentioned in previous messages, it also has a socket for
the 4mhz 9511A arithmetic processor.

The H19[A] requires power supply modifications to support all
the additional hardware which comes with an H89, so just getting
the Super 89 board won't work.  The bad news is that Heath's H89 upgrade
kit for either the H19 or H19A can't be obtained without the Heath CPU
board (the one that won't be used).

The good news is that D-G will be offering their own H19[A] upgrade kit
consisting of their 64K board and the power supply mods for $950-$1000.
It should be available in late September.  One buys Heath's disk controller,
disk, and possibly their 3-port serial interface, and you've got it made.
The Super 89 runs a standard Heath CP/M, and MP/M will be forthcoming
(they wouldn't say when).

I should re-iterate that my experience was on the Intertec INTERTUBE II 
terminal, not the Superbrain. The Company may have gotten its head together,
quality control wise. I personally would be very wary of them from past experience,
but they might have a fairly reliable computer in the Superbrain.

   I find it hard to believe that you have had so many problems
with Intertec.  The company I work for has purchased 6
Superbrains so far.  I must say that we have been very happy
with them so far.

  First of all, not one of them was "dead on
arrival".  The store we purchased them from would take them out
of the box and try them out before selling them.  However, I
dont remember seeing a Superbrain fail that test.  

  The problems we have had with the machines have all been
related to the power supply or the floppy disc drives.  In the 2
years we've had them, most of them have broken down at one point
or another (I think a couple are still going strong).  When they
do break, we've generally shipped them down to Intertec.  In all
cases, Intertec repaired the units and shipped them back in 2
weeks.  I also think the repair costs were reasonable.

  By the way, the cost of schematics for SB's is $50.  I also
have a set for Intertubes/Emulators that cost me a whole $25.
Although they did not come with any explanations, I found the SB
schematics to be complete and accurate: I have repaired a couple
of them myself).

  I have also had the occasion to speak with some of the
Intertec customer service/technical staff.  Most of them have
been very helpfull and very willing to spend their time trying
to figure out some of my problems, hardware and sofware, with
the machines.

  All in all, Superbrains are great machines for the price.  We
have found them to be pretty reliable and easy to repair.  They
are now selling for $2000 and a 10M hard disc goes for $2700. 
Who else is selling similar machines for that price?

Hi,

  At the risk of starting a deluge of 'preference' type messages, here is
some information relative to the recent virtual memory message.

  Zilog has developed the Z8003 Virtual Memory Processing Unit (an extended
Z8001) which, when used in conjunction with the Z8015 Paged Memory Management
Unit, should make virtual memory multitasking systems easier to implement.
The chip set runs at a 10 MHz clock rate and addresses up to 48Mbytes of
distinct memory space.

  Anyone interested in this stuff drop me a line.  I'm currently working on
a multitasking OS for the Z8K for my thesis project, but I plan to stick
with Zilog for a while to come (at least until the 68K shows me that it
uses it's registers a bit more efficiently).

It seems the Non Linear Systems Kaycomp II is now called the
Kaypro II.  At least that's what the unit I received recently
is labelled.  After about 5 days of use, here are my observations:

	1.  The case.  Not very pretty, but functional.  It's
constructed of painted aluminum and seems reasonably sturdy.  The
power cord is stored on the outside of the case wrapped around four
corner posts.  There is no storage for floppies ala Osborne.  Weight
is about 24 lbs.

	2.  The keyboard.  One of the best features of the machine.
Very similar to a VT-100.  Codes generated by cursor arrows or any
key on the numeric pad can be re-defined.  The keyboard touch is
excellent.  Keyboard attaches with a nice long coiled telephone
style cord with standard modular connectors at both ends.  Caps lock
key has a red LED indicator.

	3.  The display.  Good news and bad news.  The good news is it
produces a highly readable 80X24 display on a 9" P31 green screen.  The
memory mapped display is very fast and apparently doesn't take up any
user address space (bank switched?).  The bad news is the annoying presence
of video "noise" on the screen during screen update (random flashes and
specks).  Also there are no video attributes available.

	4.  The disks.  The Kaypro uses two single sided double density
40 track mini floppies.  STAT will report 191K on a freshly formatted
disk.  Disk I/O seems to be fairly fast.  Disk copies and large program
loads go at a brisk pace.  A 5" Winchester option is in testing stages.

	5.  The CPU.  Removing the top cover reveals a single board
computer with a 2.5 MHz (why not 4 MHz?) Z80 CPU with 64K bytes of
RAM (8 64K chips).  Included are one serial port and one Centronics
parallel port.  The ports use Zilog SIO and PIO chips.  The floppy
controller is a 1791.  *ALL* chips are socketed.  Workmanship looks
good and servicability looks excellent.

	6.  The software.  The CP/M provided seems to be a reasonable
implementation.  The FORMAT and COPY utilities provided include verify
options and work well.  A BAUD program allows software definition of
the serial port baud rate.  Unfortunately, the CBIOS source code was
not provided.  I'm checking to see if it can be made available.  The
other software included is the SELECT word processor, SBASIC, PROFITPLAN,
and UTILYZE.  I'm not excited about SELECT, although it looks like it
might be a good choice for a non computer oriented person.  I will be
bringing up some other CP/M editors as soon as I load them over from
8" disks.  I haven't tried any of the other software yet, so can't
comment on it.

----Summary----

In general, it seems to be a great buy at $1795 list.  The Ozzie includes
a better package of software, but the Kaypro seems to have the edge on
hardware features.  How well it stands up remains to be seen.

	Regarding the previous article on differences between the 68000
and the 68010:  You should already know that the 68000 does not handle
instruction restart.  The only way you can implement a true Virtual
Memory architecture using the 68000 is to use two processors.  One

one is handling the exception.  You can optimize this a little,
but the code is very nasty (speaking from experience here).

	The 68010, then, needs no fancy hackery.  Like a PDP-11,
it can restart instructions.  Equipped with an MMU, you could handle
various forms of VM.  The SUN machine has an architecture which
lends itself nicely to dropping in a 68010 (pin-for-pin compatible
with the 68000, remember), and a little exception handling code,
and ending up with a much more powerful system.

	Seems like this has been explained before, somewhere.  I
can only hope the readers of this list are now enlightened.

A couple of months ago I posteda request for some info on cheap Z80
based micros to be used for word processing.  The upshot of my
search was that, except for the kit builder type, none are really
available now, though some will be available in a few months (notably
KAYCOMP II and Micro-Decisionware). Since I needed the capability
now, I thought some of you might find my solution {amusing|horrifying}.
I'm buying a KSR printer, and using a VAX for computer power.
The personal computer age just hasn't arrived quite yet.

I am beginning now to think about buying a 16-bit micro.  I will be
making the purchase next June, and I want to spend about $8-10K.
This is to include hard-disc, terminal, unix-software, and about
256K.  I realize that every week (just about) someone introduces
new systems, but I figure that it is the systems that are available
*now* that will be in good shape a year from now.  One other criteria
is that hardware/software support be available both here and overseas,
since this machine will probably be used in a commercial venture.
Strange to relate (on net.micro.68k, no less) I find the DEC-PC
very tempting in terms of price, performance and support.  My
"best-bet" system would be someone offering a 68000 board for the
DEC-PC.  An article in Mini-MIcro Systems seems to imply this latter
possibility is remote, saying that DEC will try to keep the specs on
the PC "private", to discourage outsider hardware.  With this long
introduction I come to my query(ies):

(1) Could all you people who have currently available 68K systems
with Unix send me mail on what you hardware/software configuration
is and how much these cost?

(2) If anyone is planning, or knows of someone who is planning a 68k
board for the DEC-PC, could you please send me info?

I am sure that my results will be of general interest, so I'll post
a summary to the net.  Hence, if anyone wants to keep any info
confidential, please indicate that in your response.

Hoping to hear from you all soon,

	Just a warning about the prices I posted earlier:  I have no idea
how firm they are.  (also, I think I meant ">" instead of "<").

	I have a spec sheet for the part.  It comes in a 40-pin pack.
They claim it to be totally source & object code compatible with the 68000,
and vice-versa.  Address and data busses are still non-multiplexed.  I
still don't have any performance information.

I have been using the Whitesmiths C compiler which runs on our
vax and generates code for the 68000.  It has downloading utilities
(that can generate S Records) and other items including an assembler
(non-standard) as part of the package.  While it is not the best in
the optimum code generation department, it is sufficient.

There are a few bugs in it, but I have been able to work around them.

I just, for the first time in my life, laid eyes on the new IBM PC.  WOW!
Leave it to IBM to make a personal computer that doesn't look like a refugee
from a hardware lab.  I was extremely impressed by the good integration
of the package/display.  I saw both the color and monochrome video display,
and the monochrome is a definite win.  Its much better than most video
terminals.  The keyboard is also a win, (excellent feel).  I was a little
disapointed in the low memory density provided, (16K elements), but that
is fixable by buying an outside memory board.  (256K with a serial and
parallel port is available outside).

A word of caution about IBM's async communications package however, the
software CANNOT hack terminal emulation at 1200 baud, (much less 2400), its
partially written in basic.  The excellent CROSS-TALK package is available
for CPM-86 (one of 3 OS's available, the best is M-DOS however).   A
C compiler is available, (but not thru IBM).  The COMPUTERLAND outlet in
Timonium has a good selection of software also.  In particular, VISICALC
and WORDSTAR are supposed to be real wins, (although expensive).

There are assembly language implementations of terminal handling done,
I would be particularly interested in one that emulates several popular
terminals, (VT-100, Concept 108, etc.).

One can implement dynamic stack growth via paging without being able
to restart aborted instructions.  Map unallocated pages to the same
"free" page in memory and set the memory management hardware to
generate an interrupt when a read/write occurs in this area (e.g.
when the stack grows downward into an "unallocated" page).  Rather
than aborting the "fault"-generating instruction in the middle,
allow it to complete (since it is reading/writing "real" memory),
and then (after it is done) an interrupt will occur.  Presumably the
MMU hardware will tell you the page that generated the fault.  If it
is above the SP, allocate the page and map another "free" page into
all of the "unallocated" slots.  If it is below the SP, generate a
segmentation violation signal and blow the process away.

A possible problem is a write onto a set of locations that cross a
page boundary.  If no uninterruptable instructions can write more than
a page-size's worth of bytes at once, then this problem can be solved
by using two "real" pages and mapping successive virtual pages to
alternate real ones.

The "Sextant" summer 1982, p.106 showes the architecture of the new Z-machines 
very clearly.  No way that I can see to upgrade a Z/H-19 to this impressive 
new family of micros.  However, the Super 89 from D-G Electronic 
Developments Co. 700 S. Armstrong, Denison, TX 75020, (214)-465-7805 (Brian

What they mean is that their memory management will be able to handle the 68010
not that their boards will currently allow demand paging. As it stands, they
point out that they can not handle this, and that you need to wait for the
68010 for full paging. The system can handle paging of either just data or
instructions (I don't remember which) currently.

I got a request to describe the systems that I thought were much better than
Unix and hope will be available by the time the hardware to run them reaches
affordable prices. The following is my (belated) reply. I thought it of
enough interest to be posted to the lists. My apologies to those who
get it twice.

Eden, smalltalk, etc. are representatives of the what I hope will be the
next generation of operating systems. These systems are generically referred
to as "object" based systems. Their primary characteristic is that they
don't have file systems; everything in an object driven system is always in
memory, some memory is just slower than other memory.

Some of the features these systems can display:

	1) user supplied object topologies
	2) dynamic linking to objects
	3) I/O redirection by name substitution
	4) Automated desktop style command processors

These things imply some slick capabilities. User supplied topologies
means that I can organize my `files' any way I please, using any naming
convention I want. Dynamic linking to objects means that if a bug gets
fixed in a library, I won't have to relink programs that use the
library; they'll pick the new one up when I run them. Finally, I/O
redirection by name means that you can do things like

	"run this program; when it asks for object klaatu, give it
	object barado instead"

Similar magic should apply to subroutine linkage, etc.

Smalltalk is a language/system (similar to BASIC in the binding of the
operating system and the language) developed by Xerox, to be release to the
public "soon". The Rossetta Corporation has an implementation of Smalltalk
'76 on a z80. See the August '81 issue of Byte for information.

Eden is a system being worked on by a group of people at the University of
Washington. It is designed to run on 1 to 4 iAPX-432's (gulp) as part of a
local ethernet system. One of the aims of the Eden project is to build a
good environment for doing CS research.  See the Proceedings of the Eigth
Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (December '81 OSR) for
information.

The etc include iMAX-432, being developed by Intel for the iAPX-432. This is
the only object driven system currently available to the public. For
information, check the Eigth SOSP mentioned above.

In addition, I have been playing with the idea of putting some form of
object driven system on my current (z80) hardware. It's not clear that such
a thing is possible. The lack of a hard disk is particularly noticeable.

   I just talked to Andy Bell at the Wellesley Heathkit Center.  He says
it's very unlikely (probably not possible) to directly upgrade an H19 to
the Z100.  The Z100 has 5 slots instead of three, and has a much larger
board that he doesn't think would fit in the H19 cabinet.

   He did suggest an alternative for those interested in upgrading to
something more powerful than the H89.  The Wellesley Center (but not
Heathkit itself) will be offerring the D. G. Electronics Super-89 board
for $829.  It is designed to be an H89 upgrade kit.

   The Super-89 allows up to 256K bytes of RAM, and uses a Z80 at 4 MHz.
It has a real time clock and calendar, six I/O slots and two RS-232 ports.
It is compatible with HDOS and Magnolia systems; MP/M from D. G. will be
released soon.  In August, RAMdisk capability for the Super-89 will
become available.  The Super-89 meets F.C.C. Type B RFI specs.

   The Super-89 is supposedly mentioned in a Heathkit newsletter.  Andy
thought that a number of Heathkit Centers would probably start carrying it,
but Heath itself probably won't mention it.  Interested people may call
the Wellesley Heathkit Center, (617) 237-1510.  If you call, please

	And, does it use the same chassis as the H19?  Could I

The recent issue of 'PC Magazine' is distributing the listing of
an IBMPC basic programme which will double the speed of the
floppy disk's sold with the IBMPC.  The programme creates a file
called 'speedup.com' which patches disk timing parameters in the
IBM DOS to less conservative values.
 
05 REM SPEEDUP DISK-ZAP
10 FOR I = 1 TO 37: READ N: C = C + N
15 NEXT: READ N: IF N <> C THEN 40
20 RESTORE: OPEN "R", 1, "SPEEDUP.COM", 1
25 FIELD 1,1 AS N$: FOR I = 1 TO 37
30 READN N: LSET N$ = CHR$(N): PUT 1
35 NEXT: CLOSE: PRINT "CREATED": END
40 PRINT "**ERROR - VERIFY DATA**": END
45 DATA 186, 18, 0, 184, 30, 37, 205, 33, 139
50 DATA 250, 190, 26, 1, 185, 11, 0, 243, 164
55 DATA 51, 192, 205, 19, 139, 215, 205, 39
60 DATA 223, 2, 37, 2, 8, 42, 255, 80, 246, 0, 4
65 DATA 3866
70 END
 
This programme is on page 151, Volume 1, Number 3.
If you put the 'speedup' command in the autoexec.bat file
you can hear the disk's speed change immediately afterward.

We at the University of Oklahoma have a problem that I am certain that
others out there have run into. Namely, doing file uploads/downloads
from/to an IBM 370 like machine, running (of course) an os/370 like
operating system.

The problem with this is that the 370 talks to the outside world
through a magic beast called the 3705, which does nasty things, such as:

	1) Not accept a certain (unknown) set of control characters.
	2) Not accept input when it isn't listening.
	3) Has no flow control from the terminal end.

And need I go on?

Anyway, we need to send text and binary to/from this beast, from micros
ranging from apples & trs-80, through LSI 11's. We are in desperate
need of software to do this, and have found the following
(unacceptable) alternatives:

	1) Something from UCLA
	2) Something from Stanford
	3) Something from Waterloo
	4) Something homegrown

If anybody out there has something that works under the above
constraints, doing it all using only the 95 printable ascii characters
plus CR or NL, please let me know.

Cost constraints:

	1) IBM software needs to be free or cheap (< $1000)
	2) Micro software needs to be free, or givable away once we have
		it, plus relatively cheap.
	3) Micro software should be in a high level language, (Pascal or
		BASIC preferred), and easy to understand (whatever that
		means).

If enough interest is shown, I will summarize for the net.

	Thanx,
	mike

that the 68000 does not allow reasonable paging, and that people should
wait for th 68010.  I have also seen claims by SMI and CadLinc that their
SUN board behaves exactly like the 68010 memory-management-wise, so
software will be plug compatible when the 68010 boards come out.
Will someone please explain?

I received several responses to my request for 68000 UNIX information.
The most important was a summary from aron shtull-trauring
(harpo!presby!aron) of the information he had received from his earlier
request.  The most significant new information is:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Consider this contribution annonymous:

            Radio Shack will be supplying what you want.  The target
    date is late November.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MIT, Stanford, Lucasfilm, SMI, Cadlink, and most likely
all the other SUN-based workstation companies all
offer some version or another of V7 UNIX for the 68000.

************

Unsubstantiated rumor claims that Microsoft is doing their usual half-assed
job bringing up Unix on the Tandy machine.  The TRS-80 mod 16's internal
architecture is pretty awful so even a good Unix might not run all that
well.


************  [The rest of this message is the previous summary.  B.J.]


As has been mentioned in WorkS, the 68000 doesn't really support paging
or even the automatic stack growth that UNIX uses.  So a *good* UNIX isn't
likely till the 68010 or 68020 are available.

The major problem is that an instruction that is aborted in the middle
by any sort of memory management fault cannot in general be restarted;
thus, demand paging is totally impossible.  On 11s, that isn't a problem,
but UNIX does depend on page faults on stack references to know when to
expand it.  This could be faked by including some restartable (or perhaps
unneeded) instruction at the entry to each block that would reference the
bottom of the new stack; that could force the expansion.  Of course, there
would be extra overhead for each subroutine call in that case.

Microsoft has committed to producing UNIX versions for all of the major
16-bit micros, including the 68000.  To the best of my knowledge, the
only one they're marketing now is for LSI-11/23s.  I strongly suspect
that they will wait until they can get a UNIX 3.0 -based system before
releasing any others.  Not that it's necessarily technically better, but
Bell's licensing terms (for them) are far superior.

The real problem, though, will be with the disk -- UNIX is a heavily
I/O-bound system, and can't really survive on floppies.  A 5-10M
Winchester is the minimum configuration, I'd say, that will really
support UNIX.

Several folks other than Microsoft are also planning "UNIX-like" systems.
I am told that HP will offer one; I don't know, though, if they're doing
it themselves or what.

************

     If you read WorkS digest you should have seen an entry about the
     Sun workstation. It is a 68000 based graphics work station and it
     supports Unix. You may be able to get the software for a TRS-80
     from the people at Stanford who are working on it.

************

Gee -- after saying it would be a while, I just saw an ad in the Feb. BYTE
for a 68000-based V7 UNIX system.  The ad is by "DUAL" -- no mention of
hard disks, but they list a beginning price of $8295.  The UNIX system is
by UNISOFT of Berkeley, CA.


************

        In Thomas/Yates (A User Guide to the Unix System, Publ. by Osborne-
McGraw-Hill in Berkeley) the following are listed:

Unix:
        (1) Microsoft, 400 108 Av., N.E., #200, Bellvue, WA 98004
                (XENIX--a Unix look-alike)
        (2) Uni-Soft, 2405 4 St., Berkeley, CA 94710
        (3) Mark Williams Co., 1430 W. Wrightwood Av., Chicago, IL 60614
                (COHERENT, an O/S based on Unix)
        (4) Whitesmiths, Ltd., 1780 B'way, #601, New York, NY 10019
                (IDRIS, an O/S based on Unix)
C:
        (1) Alcyon Corp., 8474 Commerce Ave., San Diego, CA 92121

        I'm certain there are many others.  I know Lucasfilms, (the Star
Wars Company!) has brought a 68000 Unix, but isn't supporting it; they
should be listed in the Marin County (area code 415) phone book.

************

UNIX on 68K... originally done at MIT, available from LUCASFILM,
(on a SUN MULTI-bus system), WICAT on their own 68K system, Microsoft
(XENIX) on a QBUS 68K board--soon on other processors, Fortune on their
own system (proprietary bus), plus a few more in progress...

************

Whitesmith's and lots of other people have 68000 based UNIX products.
There must have been almost a dozen vendors of that type of
gear at last week's UNIX conference.  Read BYTE for more
info on this kind of things.
                          ^ thing, not things.  Damn mail program.

************

*Unix has been brought up on a 68000. What I was suggesting was that if
 one was going to buy a Sun it would be better to wait for the
 68010 since demand paging gives one greater capabilities with respect
 to timesharing and having multiple processes running simultaneously.
 But 68000 Unix is up and running well from what I can discern.

************

Yes, the 3.0 license will allow cheaper Unices, but I suspect that most
vendors haven't converted yet; given how slowly Western moves, they may
not even have their licenses yet.  I'd give it a few more months.  I've
been told that a 3.0 license subsumes v7 and 32V, so presumably anyone
who's now marketing a v7-based system will be able to sell the same thing
under the new terms, but I'm not certain of that.

About Xenix:  yes, it is real UNIX v7.  They've rewritten some sections
for improved reliability and speed, and added some stuff, but as far
as I know, any program that runs under v7 should run just fine under it.
Based on my own experiences in transporting UNIX to other machines, I'd
guess that they're also cleaning up and reorganizing code some, so that
they can support multiple machines with just one set of common source code.
For example, very many programs have a hidden dependency on the sign bit
of char variables being propogated when assigned to an int; this causes
them to break on most non-DEC machines.


************

Well, here's what I could find out so far.

There are alot of people coming out with bundled hardware/software
systems involving 68000's and Unix.  Among these are WICAT, MicroDaSys,
Dual and Fortune.  It seems every week that there is an article in
INFOWORLD announcing a new system of this sort.  In fact, in this
weeks INFOWORLD there is an article on Unix and 16 bit micros.  Most
of the above companies have full page adds in this months BYTE.

The problem, however, for the 16, is that these systems are bundled.
The hardware and software come together.  Most of these companies
are getting Unix from two places (on an OEM basis): UNISOFT in
Berkeley, CA and Microsoft in Bellevue, WA.

UNISOFT is currently V7 but will soon be Version III (or whatever
WE calls its latest concoction).  Even nicer, UNISOFT includes
the Berkeley Unix enhancements.  MICROSOFT is also V7 and I believe
will also soon be III, but does not include Berkeley stuff, although
it does have "internals" enhancements of its own.

Neither MICROSOFT nor UNISOFT is interested in selling single user
copies.  They'll only talk to you if you are an OEM.  On the other
hand, the OEM's will only sell you Unix for a 68000 inside their
own hardware.  According to the INFOWORLD article, the new WE
licensing arrangement will allow resale prices of $40 a copy for
dealers who've shelled out the $45,000 for the source-code license.

At those prices its understandable that dealers are relunctant to
sell Unix without the hardware.  There's no profit in it!

Anyway, unless someone out there has alot of money and time, and
is willing to become a TANDY and UNISOFT(or MICROSOFT) OEM, or
unless TANDY pleasantly surprises me, it may be a while before
we see Unix on the TRS-80 16.

************

Xenix 3.0 will be available for the 68000.  Xenix 2.2 (V7) is currently
ported to the 68000, but none of the machines are ready to be shipped
(one, in fact, will never be retailed to the public).  We're doing
a version for a SUN board (very sexy!) which should be complete in
6 weeks, on the streets in another 6 or 8, however fast the OEM
moves.  The second factor is the timing of Xenix 3.0, since we want
to combine some elements of Berkeley 4.1 in the release.  I expect
it will be third quarter before XENIX 3.0 is available.  Thus, 68000s
will be available sooner, but with XENIX 2.3.

As for the TRS 68000 machine, it has no memory management in its
current form.  We probably won't do anything with it until a version
with an MMU is available.

I dont understand your question about 'paging restrictions'.  If you
mean virtual memory, we will not support that until we have a real
virtual chip, either the 68010 or the 16032.  One of our OEMs,
MicroDaSys, is porting their own kernal to a 68000, and are doing
a dual-cpu virtual implimentation, where a second CPU wakes up on
a page fault, brings in the page, and lets the second one resume
from its amazingly long memory-access wait state.  I think that this
is a highly specialized system, as it does not provide general
virtual memory performance.

If you mean the fearsome restrictions in the 68000's MMU archetecture
(the Motorolla MMU chip), we've lost a lot of sleep over that design,
and we believe that we have some approaches and techniques to handle
the problem.

As for cost, the price is set by the OEM.  Since our price to them
is quite low, I would expect the OEMs to offer a very attractive price.
Many of them plan on a nice low price for the basic system, with
additional charges for some items which they hold back, such as
(for example) yacc/lex, screen editor, etc.  Our price to the
OEM is very close to the Bell price to us, which was published by
Bell at the last Usenix.  For a 15 user system, its around $300 or
so, roughly.
