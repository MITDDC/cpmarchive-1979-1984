Subject:  MTN 2.2A DCHayes Bug Fix
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

With the help of Ron Fowler (RGF@MC), we tracked down the bug using an
old listing of MTN 2.1.  (My listing and disk for MTN 2.2A are
apparently permanently and irretrievably archived...)  I have just now
found a machine with a DCHayes modem in it and tested the following
patch - and it worked!  With this patch installed in a copy of the
uncustomized MTN22A.COM, REName it to MTN22B.COM.  My apologies to all
for not finding and fixing this rather elusive bug much sooner...

This patch will prevent a reentered MTN from hanging up the phone when
there is a carrier already present:

21B4 -> 3E A5 00 (LD A,0A5H)
27ED -> 42 ("B")

For those who still have 2.2, this upgrades it to 2.2A:

2.2 -> 2.2A  11E4 to 11E7 -> 00
