I have been using Memorex 306X (3060, 3062, etc.) floppies for a couple
of years with good success.  They are cheap and available in large 
quantities.  While the 3060 series is supposedly single density, I have
used them for double with no problems.  I have used Scotch, IBM, and
Verbatim, but I have found Memorex to be the most appealing from the
price/performance standpoint.

Some people object to the "sandpaper" sound that Memorex floppies make
when spinning in their jackets.  I don't.

Well, it's like this...to the best of my experience, it is much,
spelled MUCH, more important that you have good drives (well
aligned and such) and a reliable controller.  For the past year
and a half, I have been using Shugart SA-800's and a Morrow DJ2D
controller.  I have been using Memorex and Accutrack disks.  Those
disks are single density, formatted to dual density.  In all the
time I have been using that combination, I have had three disk
errors.  I have been running my system for up to ten hours at a
time, with a daily average of five hours.  I have never found a 
need to buy double density disks, and if you try to stay away from
the really bad ones, like Georgia Magnetics (defunct) and Verbatim, 
you should not have any trouble.  However, I also back up my critical
disks weekly or at every major change, and dump them in a good
safety deposit box.  Once in a rare while, those three times I mentioned,
I have a disk die.  Usually I have had the backups. 

This is not a precise answer to your question, but can give you
an idea of my personal experience.

Good luck,
David

You failed to specify what \search/ algorithm you use!  A simple
sequential search could indeed take up gobs and gobs of time...

The subject of searching, sorting, optimal disk organization schemes,
and so forth is quite old.  I very highly recommend D E Knuth, _The
Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Searching and Sorting_,
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, MA, 1973 (ISBN
0-201-03803-X, Library of Congress Catalog Number 67-26020).

This work is, in my opinion, the classic in the field.  The twenty or
thirty dollars spent will repay themselves many times if you use this
book well.

For anyone else, I recommend all three of Knuth's books (Fundamental
Algorithms, Seminumerical Methods, and Searching and Sorting) as
invaluable reference works.  The mathematics can get very heavy at
times, but the algorithms presented and the methods for evaluating
them are clear and can almost always be applied without a deep
appreciation of their mathematical elegance.  As long as you're not
trying to use the books as you would a textbook, you're all set.

(No, I am not a spokespiece for Knuth, but merely a grateful user of
his works such as this series and his TeX and METAFONT programs.)

Have fun folks.

How do companies like MicroPro manage to produce such fast spelling programs?
Do they simply have small dictionaries?

I have been working on a program that is running 10-20 times slower (at least)
than some performance specs I have seen (3 pages, double spacing takes 3
minutes!!!)

So far, I have alphabetized my dictionary and have compressed it by putting
a byte at the beggining of approporiate words indicating the number of
characters to copy from the previous word (if it saves space, this is done).
Each word has 2 bytes following it of suffix byte flags.  The dictionary has
approximately 48,000 words as a result of the flags and resides in 92K.

The program has an index in memory so that only one 256 byte dictionary record
need be read for each word.  The directory is automatically buffered (eliminate
directory seek over extents).  I have gone so far as to fill up RAM with as
much of the dictionary as I can.

Anybody have any suggestions to improve efficiency.  I am sure that the
slowest part is disk accessing (5.25" floppies, 20ms track to track).
I guess I should minimize head travel.

Does a reasonable algorythm exist?

Thanks,
-Michael

Your comment about MicroPro hit a tender spot - their customer service
stinks.  I've tried to call them up on a couple of occasions to try to
clarify something or other from the Customization Guide.  Their attitude
is that they only want to talk to dealers.  Calling my dealer is of
no help - he doesn't understand what I'm trying to find out, so I doubt
if MicroPro understands when and if he calls them.  ~sigh~  For the
amount of money they're charging for their software, you'd think that
you would get better support.

I'd prefer a digest, as long as the delay is no more than a day or two on the
average. I would not mind a space-enthusiasts type digests, i.e. automatically
formed, add-me requests & occasional duplicates and all, with no editorial
"moderation" ala human-nets, and hence minimum time drain for the maintainer.
This also guarantees reasonably fast redistribution (limited by the number
of submissions, not by the moods of the maintainer) and lack of censorship,
things that some people have expressed concern about.
I just want the stuff to come to me once a day in a bunch.

Secondly, I don't consider lack of undigestification software on the unix
news system to be a valid reason for not going digest.  It's such a trivial
thing to do.  They have several thousand people using the thing, let somebody
write the 1 page program that's needed and distribute it to all the sites.
In any case, that shouldn't affect the decision for the whole list, they
can always stay direct as a special (hardship?) case.

Morrow's CPM distribution disk includes a program to do this called
SINGLE.COM. They give you the source code. Basically it asks you to to
swap disks whenever a reference is mae to a different disk to the one
currently selected. However, it requires you to modify your BIOS and
leave a hook in it. You may not be able to do this easily if you have
not hacked CPM. Do you have a friendly CPM wizard close by?
  What would be easier would be to tell your system that you only have
one drive on your system; this is documented in the digital research
distribution package.
Good luck.

A selective erase program which works like the ERAQ in MP/M is

It requires M80 to assemble.  This is a very nice erase utility
that works in any user area under CP/M 2.2.  It asks yes/no
and then continues.  It's particularly nice because even if the
file is R/O or SYS it's possible to erase without having to use

Via:  Brl-Bmd; 4 Aug 82 21:47-EDT

An open query to the readership:

With the recent discussion on the diffusion of public domain software into 
the proprietary area, what about information going the other way?

In particular I am faced with a situation in that someone has asked me for a 
copy of a certain document that I wrote.  The document was created from both 
the WordStar operators manual and the WordStar Customization notes and 
consists of about 4 pages of nothing but patch labels, hex locations, purpose 
of location and defaults.  I had made this up several months ago as I 
created several individualized versions of WordStar for the people that used 
my office machine.  A would say about half the locations are from the manual 
and half from the notes.  For instance, more than one page is taken just 
from the various terminal and printer control codes in the manual.

"Obviously" this information is proprietary.  Or is it?  Is is absolutely 
useless to anyone without WordStar.  But MicroPro charges $100 for the 
customization notes and they would be useless too without WordStar.  
(Somewhere I heard the price is now $250 - if it is, it's not worth it.)  If 
one listens to somebody like Sorcim (SuperCalc) even copying one page from 
the manual is reason for law suits.  Every page of their manual is marked 
"reproduction by any method is strickly prohibited" and they want $50 per 
user (plus the original purchase price) if SuperCalc is put on multi-user 
machines.

So how should this be treated?  What I have been doing is simply using the 
list to answer specific questions such as the recent INFO-CPM question of 
where is the .po default location, but not freely giving out the entire 
list.  For that matter do the third person vendors that write such things as 
the "Introduction of WordStar" pay a fee/royality to MicroPro?  That 
document is based on the WordStar users manual just like mine is.

And in passing, the MicroPro WordStar customization are good if you what it 
do such things as moving commands around, changing defaults, or change the 
message texts that are produced.  They do not tell you how WordStar works 
nor do they give all the possible settings.  (One of the reasons I bought 
them was to find the location and change some of the "special find 
characters", print control characters, default tabstops, and screen overlap.  
None of these are listed. - Anybody else know where they are?  MicroPro has 
been very consistant to my requests - they have ignored both me, my company 
letterhead, and two different vendors that I've asked through.)

As this is something that I like to do, that is distill documentation down 
to a bare usable minimum for reference purposes after reading the full 
documentation, I'm sure this will happen again.  (I've also got a one 
standard page complete WordStar command summary, one page terminal control 
codes [the H19 only took 2-1/2" by ~4"!])  

What's your opinion?                          -- Bob Bloom (bbloom at brl)

P.S.  My 8 bits on INFO-MICRO/CPM:  Why not merge MICRO and CPM and them 
split them between the 8 bit world and 16 bit universe?  I find all of the 
16bit stuff a "bit" uncomprehensable.  (sorry)

While helping a friend select boards for his S-100 system, we realized the
difficulty in choosing one board over another.  Besides the problem of
catalog descriptions making even the worst board look great, the "trusted"
names in S-100 stuff (Godbout, Morrow, etc.) have to manufacture boards 
which are similar, but have "minor" differences (e.g. Morrow sells four
stock versions of Disk Jockeys:  Memory Mapped at E000, Memory Mapped at
F800, I/O Mapped, and DMA).

For starters, I'd like to conduct an S-100 Floppy Disk Controller survey.
If you own or use an S-100 system with a disk controller, I'd like to
know your experiences with it.  Here's the info that I'd like to collect:

1.  The Make, Model Number, and year of manufacture of the Disk Controller.
2.  Number of years that you've used the controller.
3.  Features that the board has that you like (or feel worth mentioning).
4.  Features that the board lacks which you wish it had.
5.  Reliability info:  Does the board run "forever", does it have a habit of
    dying, etc.
6.  Service record:  Number of hardware failures, and number of repairs.
7.  Software support:  CP/M included?  Ease of modifying BIOS.
8.  Documentation:  Good board documentation?  Good configuration/BIOS
    documentation?
9.  If you've had to deal with the manufacturer, are they helpful?
10. Any other info which you consider important.

If you wish to respond to this survey, please send your replies to
DAN@MIT-ML.  Please be terse (i.e. I don't need detailed hardware
descriptions of your board).  In a week or so, I'll crunch all the replies
and make the survey results available.  Individual replies will be
kept confidential (as usual).  I am especially interested in hearing
from people using the newer DMA controllers.  Please do NOT send info
about S-100 Hard Disk Controllers (yet).  I know that there are alot
of people out there who use S-100 Floppy Disk Controllers, so any info
would be greatly appreciated.

As one who has been hacking Ron Cain's C compiler, with intentions of
selling the end result, I feel the need to respond to Roger's comments.
I agree that it is basically immoral to sell something that is available
for free.  However, if there is value added to the item, additional value
for which people are willing to pay, things begin to get fuzzy.

When does a program cease being a "modified" version, and become a "new"
program.  I don't know how other folks operate, but I borrow from my
old programs as much as possible when I write a new one.  Makes little sense
to rewrite a function when it's already written.  If the function borrowed
comes from a public domain program, and I sell my program, I don't feel
like I'm ripping anyone off; on the contrary, I'm saving the customer money
because I can sell the program cheaper, having taken less time to write it.

Things are even fuzzier when dealing with a programming tool.  I am forever
indebted to Ron Cain for his generosity, as much of what I now know about
compilers came from seeing his code.  I could not have even attempted the
hacking I have done without it.  Nevertheless, I am not under any obligation
to be as generous.  My compiler is radically different, even though some
functions appear in their original form.  Finally, I plan to offer extensive
support, which Ron Cain chose not to do.

The Good Book says "give, and you shall receive".  Ron cain's generosity has
sparked a C language frenzy in the micro world, from which everyone,
including Ron, has benefitted.  There is a wide choice of compilers, C
programs and packages out there now that weren't there before.  The lasting
benefit which I appreciate most is the generation of compiler hackers
that will be ready to tackle the next language challenge.

those bytes in an obvious place because the BIOS inserts those bytes
"by hand".

What you should do, instead, is change the JMP or CALL address at D303
(or to the address where THAT jump/call points to), and insert your
address there.  Make sure your routine, in turn, jumps to the next
address after the patched address, and includes whatever instruction
you may have overlaid if you did not patch over a jump.  Do not end
with a RET, of course...

The H89 was weirdly org'd for downward compatability with the H8.
I should know - I was there for the decision (bad as it was).
The H89A was a redo of the "one-week-wonder" by Harry Archer to allow
it to better compete with the rest of the normal CP/M machines.

I want to add one tiny routine to my North Star CP/M warm boot.
At 0000H I find C3 03 D3.  An easy way to add the routine would
be to make the jump go to the user bios area, and then jump to 
D303H.  However, I can't find on the DISK the bytes that live at 
0000H in the MEMORY once I have booted.  Does anyone know how
these three bytes are generated and placed in memory?

I dof't know if this has been asked, but here goes, would it
be possable to hack in a "set prompt" command of some sort?

As is, seems the ondy way to set it is to hack it into the code,
also, How do I get a CP/M for an INS8080A? Does DR make one?

Would you know there address? And / or what they are asking for 8080/Z80
cp/m?? Both source and com??? (I would lake to hack some cp/m on
my own, but first would like to get a system running...)..

It seems to be at the same location it was in WS 2.x, which is $037E
if you are running with a standard CP/M system.  Add $4300 to that if

Via:  Brl; 2 Aug 82 10:50-EDT
Via:  Brl-Bmd; 2 Aug 82 11:47-EDT

        CCP-GROUP is currently formulating  plans  for  the  next
release  of  ZCPR,  and if anyone wishes to see something changed
about ZCPR or a significant and "reasonable" new feature added to
it, please feel free to send your ideas to CCP-GROUP at BRL.

        CCP-GROUP is small  by  choice  and  necessity,  and  the
membership is currently frozen.  The chief reason for this is be-
cause, thru experience, we have found that design by committee to
be  highly  non-productive if the committee size exceeds 5 or so,
and CCP-GROUP is now running at around 5  members,  and  we  all-
too-frequently find this to be too large of a group for effective
design work.  We feel that ZCPR came out originally  in  a  good,
workable,  and  extensible form due to the previous effort of the
group, and, with several significant new ideas proposed,  we  are
considering putting out a new "sanctioned" release of ZCPR.

        Anyway, getting on with the new ZCPR,  some  of  the  key
enhancements currently under consideration include:

        1.  a non-echoed input for the pause in the TYPE command

        2.  an optional verification prompt for the ERA  command;
this will print the file names to be erased and then ask the user
if he wishes to do so, as per Frank Wancho's mod transmitted ear-
lier

        3.  a totally-new indirect command  file  facility  (ZSUB
instead  of SUBMIT and XSUB) which optionally combines SUBMIT and
XSUB capabilities into one command as well as providing  command-
file flow control and other nice JCL features

        4.  a new command called PATH, which allows the  user  to
dynamically  specify  the  command-search hierarchy; examples in-
clude:

                PATH                    <-- display current path
                PATH $,a10,b11,a0       <-- search current, A10, B11,
                                                and A0 in that order


        If anyone has ideas of other facilities to add or change,
feel free to submit a comment.

Well, come on! Info-micro has a slightly different audience, so it is
not unreasonable to assume that messages sent to it will not be read
by all the users on info-cpm. Also, info-micro was inactive for a long
while, so many newcomers to the net may not be aware of its existence.
Anyway, any reasonable mail-reading program can be told to just
display headers, so you can delete duplicated messages without
experiencing the anguish of re-reading the full text. I think Keith is
doing a service; if he doesn't mind, it certainly helps me.

Thanks for the information on the /X, /P, and /D switches in L80.
Yes, you are correct about the memory images for programs ORG'd
at high memory; they do tend to be quite large.  One interesting thing that
I have encountered as a solution to this problem is  the MT Microsystems
linker for their CP/M Pascal.  Their linker assumes that if the /P
switch is specified, then it is up to the user to locate his memory
image himself.  The result is code that cannot run under CP/M directly
(as a COM file ORG'd at 100H), but which saves a significant amount
of disk space.

        Re your M80/L80 note, L80 does provide switches  (/P  and
/D) to allow placement of the data and code areas almost anywhere
you desire.  Code can be generated, say, to reside in a  PROM  in
high  memory.   One trick to note about this is to use the /X op-
tion to generate a hex file rather than trying to generate a  COM
file,  since  L80  generates a COM file starting at 100 hex.  COM
files for programs in high memory are frequently quite large.

If what you're talking about is that when you warm-boot, you end up back
in user zero, I believe that the problem is in your BIOS. You see,
location 4 is not only your current disk, but it is also (bits 7 thru 4)

I have an IBC System 40 running CPM 2.2 with 2 8-inch floppies and software
which knows about and requires two floppies.  I also have an IBC CADET 20
running CPM 2.2 with 1 8-inch floppy.  I'd like to get the software which
requires two drives to run on the 1 drive system by mapping all references
to the second drive (B:) to calls to use the first (A:).  Is this possible?

     The operating system on the 1 floppy system, incidently thinks that
there are two drives and any reference to drive B: causes the disk
controller to crash (the system hangs after trying to select drive B:).
I don't know enough about CPM to patch this and SYSGEN a new system.
Things are also difficult since the PUTSYS and GETSYS programs supplied
with the system also assume that there is a drive B: and have hardcoded
into the system references to this drive.  
     The suppliers of the version of CPM (Integrated Business Computers of
California) are on vacation for a month making it difficult to get a new
version of CPM which assumes that there is only one drive.  Can I patch the
system into thinking this?  And once I do it, can I hack something so that
references to drive B: in software actually use drive A:.  The reason why
this is necessary is that the developer of the applications software which
we are using won't havve a one-disk version out for another year and I want
to get it working on our 1-disk system before that time.

1. First off, any forwarding that goes on should keep the original header
   and just add a Remailed-by: W8SDZ etc. lines.  This would make it possible
   to easily reply to the original message, and save us from double headers.
   Ask the ITS mail hackers how to do that.

2. I would suggest that you internally reorganize the two lists into
   info-micro-and-cpm, info-micro-only, info-cpm-only, and have info-micro =
   1st and 2nd, info-cpm= 1st and 3rd.  This would be internal only.
   However, you could then restrict the forwarding to just the
   info-cpm-only folk.

While it does clutter things up a bit for a short time, I find

It does give me a chance to see things I might otherwise not see

If you would like to have a program to test diskettes, there is
one called FINDBAD (version 5.4 is the latest).  It reads every
sector and when it finds a bad one, it adds that CP/M "group"
to a table of group numbers which is put into a dummy file at
the conclusion of the run.  The program does not write to the disk,
only reads.  By creating the dummy file, it causes CP/M to think
those groups are "in use", this "locking out" the bad sectors.

This public-domain program has been around for quite awhile,
works on CP/M 1.4 or 2.2 (does version number test and then reads
the disk parameter block to determine physical characteristics of
the disks).  It works great on hard disks too.

The file is available from MIT-MC as AR20:CPM;FNDBAD 54ASM.

I am aware of (although I haven't used) the following 6502 development
tools running unnder CP/M:

	[1] Microsoft ALDS.  The documentation that I have seen on
	    this product appears to be extensive.  However, I do
	    not know whether ALDS is available for systems other
	    than the Apple II CP/M implementation.  ALDS appears
	    to look like just another release of Microsoft's M80,
	    but it has a '.6502' pseudo-op to cause assembly of
	    the 6502 opcodes.

	    Drawbacks:  (please correct me if I'm wrong on this
	    point, someone)  M80 produces relocatable code which
	    must be linked with L80, Microsoft's linker.  The
	    linker makes it difficult to locate software in certain
	    areas of memory, making it occasionally (if not frequently)
	    unsuitable for development of software for foreign
	    (non-CP/M) environments.  Also, both M80 and L80 use
	    a cryptic (DEC-like) command syntax.

	    Advantages:  Fairly powerful macro capability, separate
	    code and data segments, good set of pseudo-ops.

	[2] Sorcim ACT-65.  This is an absolute assembler which
	    produces Intel hex-format output.  ACT-65 also has
	    macro capability, but from the documentation, does
	    not appear to have very powerful string handling
	    (e.g. an '&' operator, as in M80).  Although it
	    does not generate relocatable code (as implied by
	    the adjective "absolute"), there is a file inclusion
	    facility which helps circumvent the problem somewhat.
	    ACT-65 has a fairly robust set of pseudo-ops.


	[3] Avocet XASM65.  Advertised in BYTE.  I've never seen
	    a manual, so I can't tell you anything about it, except
	    for what appears in the ad.  It appears to be an
	    absolute assembler, a la ACT65.

   As for getting the softwware onto the target system, I have seen
nothing that sells with the packages mentioned above.  You'll either
have to ROM it, ram it through a serial port, or have some kind of
interchange format for diskettes.

grins, Jerry Sweet.

Is there a disassembler for the 8080/Z80 available that will run on a
VAX under Berkeley UNIX 4.1? Probably anything written in PASCAL or C
will work.  If there is such a beast available in the public domain I
would appreciate a pointer to it.  I am on ARPANET and can access it
via ftp if necessary.  Perhaps in the INFO-CPM archives on MC?
Thanks in advance

I got a request to describe the systems that I thought were much better than
Unix and hope will be available by the time the hardware to run them reaches
affordable prices. The following is my (belated) reply. I thought it of
enough interest to be posted to the lists. My apologies to those who
get it twice.

Eden, smalltalk, etc. are representatives of the what I hope will be the
next generation of operating systems. These systems are generically referred
to as "object" based systems. Their primary characteristic is that they
don't have file systems; everything in an object driven system is always in
memory, some memory is just slower than other memory.

Some of the features these systems can display:

	1) user supplied object topologies
	2) dynamic linking to objects
	3) I/O redirection by name substitution
	4) Automated desktop style command processors

These things imply some slick capabilities. User supplied topologies
means that I can organize my `files' any way I please, using any naming
convention I want. Dynamic linking to objects means that if a bug gets
fixed in a library, I won't have to relink programs that use the
library; they'll pick the new one up when I run them. Finally, I/O
redirection by name means that you can do things like

	"run this program; when it asks for object klaatu, give it
	object barado instead"

Similar magic should apply to subroutine linkage, etc.

Smalltalk is a language/system (similar to BASIC in the binding of the
operating system and the language) developed by Xerox, to be release to the
public "soon". The Rossetta Corporation has an implementation of Smalltalk
'76 on a z80. See the August '81 issue of Byte for information.

Eden is a system being worked on by a group of people at the University of
Washington. It is designed to run on 1 to 4 iAPX-432's (gulp) as part of a
local ethernet system. One of the aims of the Eden project is to build a
good environment for doing CS research.  See the Proceedings of the Eigth
Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (December '81 OSR) for
information.

The etc include iMAX-432, being developed by Intel for the iAPX-432. This is
the only object driven system currently available to the public. For
information, check the Eigth SOSP mentioned above.

In addition, I have been playing with the idea of putting some form of
object driven system on my current (z80) hardware. It's not clear that such
a thing is possible. The lack of a hard disk is particularly noticeable.

I agree with you, Bob.  I had been thinking that maybe I was the

I don't think the lists should be merged because their interests are
in many respects divergent.  But I also believe that the intersection
of the two sets of subscribers is large.  I have to think that most
persons who represent that intersection would not want to receive all
the duplicated articles.

We at the University of Oklahoma have a problem that I am certain that
others out there have run into. Namely, doing file uploads/downloads
from/to an IBM 370 like machine, running (of course) an os/370 like
operating system.

The problem with this is that the 370 talks to the outside world
through a magic beast called the 3705, which does nasty things, such as:

	1) Not accept a certain (unknown) set of control characters.
	2) Not accept input when it isn't listening.
	3) Has no flow control from the terminal end.

And need I go on?

Anyway, we need to send text and binary to/from this beast, from micros
ranging from apples & trs-80, through LSI 11's. We are in desperate
need of software to do this, and have found the following
(unacceptable) alternatives:

	1) Something from UCLA
	2) Something from Stanford
	3) Something from Waterloo
	4) Something homegrown

If anybody out there has something that works under the above
constraints, doing it all using only the 95 printable ascii characters
plus CR or NL, please let me know.

Cost constraints:

	1) IBM software needs to be free or cheap (< $1000)
	2) Micro software needs to be free, or givable away once we have
		it, plus relatively cheap.
	3) Micro software should be in a high level language, (Pascal or
		BASIC preferred), and easy to understand (whatever that
		means).

If enough interest is shown, I will summarize for the net.

	Thanx,
	mike

I guess I'll just have to assume that everyone on Info-CPM is also
on other mailing lists and doesn't want to see things forwarded

of intense interest to people who have CP/M systems, especially

Re:   Price change

   The recent price change was also advertised on page 320 of the August
issue of Byte.  The kit form of the H19 is now $549.90, though the
assembled Z19 is still $895.  The price includes the standard white CRT.
The green CRT is still $30 extra despite what the color ad shows.

   The price of the H89 has also dropped from $1895 to $1595, and now
includes three pieces of software instead of the previous two.

   These changes apparently are in expectation of the release of the Z100
system in another month or two.  The Z100 is their 8085/8088 16-bit
processor computer system.

It seems the Non Linear Systems Kaycomp II is now called the
Kaypro II.  At least that's what the unit I received recently
is labelled.  After about 5 days of use, here are my observations:

	1.  The case.  Not very pretty, but functional.  It's
constructed of painted aluminum and seems reasonably sturdy.  The
power cord is stored on the outside of the case wrapped around four
corner posts.  There is no storage for floppies ala Osborne.  Weight
is about 24 lbs.

	2.  The keyboard.  One of the best features of the machine.
Very similar to a VT-100.  Codes generated by cursor arrows or any
key on the numeric pad can be re-defined.  The keyboard touch is
excellent.  Keyboard attaches with a nice long coiled telephone
style cord with standard modular connectors at both ends.  Caps lock
key has a red LED indicator.

	3.  The display.  Good news and bad news.  The good news is it
produces a highly readable 80X24 display on a 9" P31 green screen.  The
memory mapped display is very fast and apparently doesn't take up any
user address space (bank switched?).  The bad news is the annoying presence
of video "noise" on the screen during screen update (random flashes and
specks).  Also there are no video attributes available.

	4.  The disks.  The Kaypro uses two single sided double density
40 track mini floppies.  STAT will report 191K on a freshly formatted
disk.  Disk I/O seems to be fairly fast.  Disk copies and large program
loads go at a brisk pace.  A 5" Winchester option is in testing stages.

	5.  The CPU.  Removing the top cover reveals a single board
computer with a 2.5 MHz (why not 4 MHz?) Z80 CPU with 64K bytes of
RAM (8 64K chips).  Included are one serial port and one Centronics
parallel port.  The ports use Zilog SIO and PIO chips.  The floppy
controller is a 1791.  *ALL* chips are socketed.  Workmanship looks
good and servicability looks excellent.

	6.  The software.  The CP/M provided seems to be a reasonable
implementation.  The FORMAT and COPY utilities provided include verify
options and work well.  A BAUD program allows software definition of
the serial port baud rate.  Unfortunately, the CBIOS source code was
not provided.  I'm checking to see if it can be made available.  The
other software included is the SELECT word processor, SBASIC, PROFITPLAN,
and UTILYZE.  I'm not excited about SELECT, although it looks like it
might be a good choice for a non computer oriented person.  I will be
bringing up some other CP/M editors as soon as I load them over from
8" disks.  I haven't tried any of the other software yet, so can't
comment on it.

----Summary----

In general, it seems to be a great buy at $1795 list.  The Ozzie includes
a better package of software, but the Kaypro seems to have the edge on
hardware features.  How well it stands up remains to be seen.

I am on both Info-micro and Info-CPM, and I am getting tired of reading
almost everything from Info-micro twice due to Keith's forwarding
it to Info-CPM.  Keith, I'm sure you feel that you're doing a
service, and if enough others agree, I'll shut up. But since the forwarding
doesn't filter out duplicated addressees, I find it to be a pain.

The message about the Interbrain Superterminals was indeed interesting,
but it wasn't CPM-specific, so why forward it to Info-CPM unless
the two lists really are serving the same purpose. If that's true,
maybe the two lists should just be merged if they can't be
properly managed.
Anyone else have an opinion?

While I have not used the Intertec Superbrain, I did work for a company at 
one time that used the Intertube II. I ran into the following problems with
the terminals at one time or another:

1) Intertec has a policy of warranties from manufacture date, not purchase
   date.. This means that most if not all of your warranty can be used up 
   while the terminal is on the manufacturers shelf (I found that 25-40
   days of actual warranty was typical).

2) Intertec seems to have a policy of shipping DOA's. Fully 30% of the
   terminals did not function on initial delivery. Intertec was VERY slow
   in repair. I found that we could easily rely on them taking 3-5 months
   to repair a DOA (not replace it), therefore removing any warranty left
   over when we got it (since they did not extend or renew warranties on 
   repair).

3) When we finally got fed up with their service, we ordered a set of
   schematics from the company (for something like $125<!>) so that we could
   hire someone locally to fix them. There were four different revision
   levels of schematics on various pages for the SAME board. After doing 
   some research,  we found out that NONE of them came close to matching
   the terminal we really had. Upon discussing this fact with Intertec, we
   were told to return the schematics for replacement/refund. This we did,
   by certified mail with a reply letter. To date, Intertec has not admitted
   receiving them, telling us to return them, or mailing them in the first
   place.

4) Our final order of Intertube's was for 12. 11 of them arrived DOA. We 
   notified Intertec that they were not acceptable, we were returning them,
   we would NOT pay for them, and that we would not order any in the future.
   We also asked for return instructions (since we were not returning them
   for repairs which we had memorized by that time). Their reply, through 
   their lawyers, was that if we didn't pay within 30 days, they would seek
   payment through small claims court. We replied, to their lawyers, that we 
   would be MORE than happy to return the terminals (with our reasons) and
   that as soon as the lawyers approved, they could expect the terminals in 
   their law offices via UPS. We have not yet received a reply for that (its
   been about 2 years).

5) All the above is mainly about the company, which I have heard has not 
   changed much. As far as the actual terminal (which may or may not relate
   to the Superbrain): The user manuals were unreadable, incomprehensible,
   and usually incorrect. the cursor controls documented rarely matched the
   way the firmware implemented them.

6) The firmware was unbelievable buggy. The hardware was under-designed and
   prone to failure. It generated spurious characters, had a tendency to 
   lock its keyboard, and generally made life miserable. The fastest we could
   reliably run the terminal with minimal cursor controls (XY and Form Feed)
   was 1200 baud. One of its best features was that it was possible to change
   the internal clock speed to match 50Hz or 60Hz from the keyboard. It also
   seemed to like to generate that code spuriously, causing some of the most 
   interesting screen graphic displays I have ever seen (on a non-graphics 
   terminal.


They might have changed the way they do things since then. I don't know.
From what I have HEARD, the only way to buy a Superbrain is to find a
reliable dealer who will ship you the unit directly from the factory
(rather than his stock), and will extend the warranty from his own
pocket. From the track record I have had with the firm, I would not be
caught DEAD with anything by the company, and you could not give it to
me.

I have CP/M running on an Apple with a BIT3 80-column board.  I have a boot
disk with MODEM on it.  The keyboard characters are redefined as follows:

ctl-k: "at" sign (I can't type this because it is the Multics line kill)
ctl-u: underscore
ctl-b: backslash
ctl-n: ^ ("hat" or uparrow, ascii 94)

Everything works fine up until the time I escape out of MODEM
with a ctl-e and do a PIP PUN:=B:FOO to transfer an ascii file down the
wire.  After a MODEM T to get back in terminal mode, I discover that:

ctl-k is now the Apple CP/M default of left square bracket
ctl-u is still underscore
ctl-b is still backslash
ctl-n is ^, but only if you hit it twice.

Most confusing.  Is this something that PIP has done, or is there something
wierd going on between PIP, the MicroModem, Multics, and the BIT3?  Anybody 
have a fix?

I have received the $29.95 JRT Pascal. It runs under CP/M
similarly to CBASIC, i.e. you compile source into an .INT
file and execute with a runtime program. There appears to 
be no way to create an executable .COM file. Despite this
minor(?) fault, it seems as good a Pascal as I have seen
advertised for 10 times the price (which JRT used to charge).
This is a very cheap way to get introduced to Pascal, as I
am doing.

Anyone know why putting a cr-lf in a submit file will keep it

That is, consider the following submit file

xsub
pip
n:=cb*.*
n:=w*.*[v]

Now if the last item there is a cr-lf in order to get you out of
pip, then regardless of whether or not there are more ocmmands
after the cr-lf, NOTHING executes when you try submitting this.
Why is this?

IBM failed to fully document everything that you need in order
to get the RS232 to interrupt.  The "user-defined" pin OUT2 on
the communications chip MUST be asserted if you wish to ever see
an interrupt.  If you do the following, your program will work
correctly:

1. Set DLAB = 1 via LCR port
2. Output the baud rate divisor
3. Output the line control bits via LCR port
4. Set the modem control register (use the following as a guide)

     mov       al,$0b                    ; DTR, RTS, OUT2 (UNDOCUMENTED)
     mov       dx,rs232_mcr_port         ; modem control
     out       al,dx

5. Set the interrupt mode via IER port
6. Enable the i8259a interrupt for the rs232

Hope this helps...

I have just uploaded an archive package of six files to MC. These programs
are written in PL/I (source not presently available) and are from CP-MIG,
the CP/M interest group on Compuserve.

This package allows the concatenation of a number of individual disk files
into one large archive file for convenience and savings of space. See the
 .HLP file for details. We hope to shortly have an assembly language utility
which will grab a specified file, perfrom command line parameter passing
and execute a .COM file . In addition, we are working on a BDS C version
which will encompass all features in one (shorter) program. The files are
as follows:

AR28:CPM;ARCADD 10COM
AR28:CPM;ARCCPY 10COM
AR28:CPM;ARCDIR 12COM

Jim, the "^P" feature of CP/M is a "real-time" function...that is,
the ^P is trapped immediately after calling BIOS for a character;
if the BIOS is not called, the function is not activated (as is the
case from within a SUBMIT file).  The only way to activate it in a
batch stream would be to determine where the BDOS keeps its "printer
on" flag, then manually set it from within a special transient you'd
have to write.  This transient would, of course, be version dependant,
since the location would change from one assembly of BDOS to the next.
  For you information, the flag is located BDOS base +030DH.  Thus,
the following code should set the flag (this is *not* tested!):
		LHLD	6	;find BDOS
		LXI	D,030DH	;offset to LISTCP
		DAD	D
		MVI	M,1	;turn it on. (MVI M,0 to turn off).
  If you need a toggle, change the "MVI M,1" to "MOV A,M ! XRI 1 !
MOV M,A".  
  Note that these locations are for CP/M 2.2 and will not work under
any other version.  Further, they won't work under DDT or SID, since
the address field at 6 is modified by these programs.

may be a simple direct solution.

        The use of the character string "^P"  will  probably  not
work since the interpretation for ^P is done in the BDOS, and the
CCP (ZCPR is what I tested against) reads the $$$.SUB  file  from
disk  and  the control character doesn't pass thru the BDOS input
routine, and, hence, is not interpreted.

        Aside from using a  directory  utility  which  gives  you
printer  output,  an  alternative  is  to implement as one of the
redirectable I/O devices a special device driver  which  provides
console  input  and console/printer output in parallel.  Then, by
simply running STAT to select the new device,  you  turn  on  the
printer  for all output to the screen, and you can run STAT again
when you are done to turn off the printer.  I am using  redirect-
able  I/O  to perform a similar function in which the device tied
to my console is a second  microcomputer,  and  I  can  send  all
screen displays to disk in this way.

Also, is there any standard for 5" CP/M disks. My machine uses

I Strongly disagree with your coment of 24 july.  My wife has
used a Vector 2600 for about 9 months as a text editor for her
translating business with nar a problem using the memorite word
processor supplied with the machine.  She types at over 100 words
a minute so wordstar gave her problems when implemented on a
chromemco and a haxeltime terminal.  She is extremely happy with
the vector.  I show her your message.  Her comment was " is he
talking about the same machine.  The vector 3 has the same feel
as the selectric 1 she was using before she descovered word
processing.  She has now completed about 12 megabytes of text
typing english from russian,bulgarian, french etc and using a nec
7700 produced several books in pretty nice copy.  memorite has
worked well for her.  Perhaps the yourexperience was with an
older machine.  We also use a 5005 at NRL for varoius data
analysis schemes and text procesing it implements a version of
mp/m.  We also have 4 chromemcos ,2 apples and 4 pdp 11/40 in our
group.  The vector has stacked up well in this environment and as
an example one of the people in the group recently bought a 3 for
his personal use . Of course we also have chromemco lovers in the
group as well.  A final point, the vector 3 has yet to give my
wife a disk error.  those tandon 5" 96 tpi drives are quite
reliable.  Joel Z

	A while ago I tried to send a message to INFO-CPM
but was having some problems getting it out.  What follows
is that message.  My appolgies to those who may be getting this for
the second time.
================

     Up until recently,  I had taken the deblocking algorithm for 
granted  while  doing some extensive (commercial) work  with  the 
BIOS/monitor for my SuperBrain.   Without much thought and a  few 
patches, I just inserted the DR supplied code.

     With  all  this  talk of problems with the  code  lately,  I 
decided  that I should sit down and really look at what it  does.  
I  was  especially  interested because  of  a  problem  sometimes 
encountered  while doing a wildcard file transfer in PIP where it 
would  lose its place in the directory and end up  skipping  half 
the files.   Checking for a patch in the BDOS,  the lack of which 
might  cause  such a condition,  I found that the patch had  been 
implemented  and so my illusive gremlin was still at  large  (and 
remains so today).

     I finally was able to comprehend how the blocking/deblocking 
algorithm  worked  and found nothing out of order except that  in 
the 2.0 release of the algorithm, DR neglected to clear UNACNT in 
READ.

     One thing that gets me is that while the read algoritms  are 
good and serve their purpose well,  it seems that the write logic 
is  a little lacking.   Would it be proper thinking to write only 
when  necessary (ie.  the way reads are done)?   Of  course,  the 
directory  write  can be used to force a  write.   This  approach 
seems  reasonable enough.   The only time data would be  lost  is 
when  either  a  cold boot is performed or the system  goes  down 
before the current buffer is written.   When you think about  it, 
entire  extents  are usually lost when this happens anyway  - the 
unwritten buffer wouldn't be missed unless you know how to use DU 
to  rebuild the extent.   Files would be closed with  the  forced 
(directory) write function (1).


			Jonathan Platt@MIT-MC

================

     Since then, I have found the problem with PIP.  It was hardware.
Any thoughts on the write-only-when-necessary philosophy?

Makers of 128k ram boards are not going with bank select, but are
using linear addressing as per the IEEE-696 (proposed) standard
because it is much more reasonable - in terms of simplicity, in terms
of on-each-board hardware, in conceptual terms, ...

For those with investments in older BS (Band Select) software,
Godbout and others make a memory mapper which maps an I/O port
onto the upper 8 address lines; this seems to have the effect
of making bank select software work with modern RAM cards.
I can't swear by it as I don't have any such software around.

In some cases track 0 is of a different density thank the other tracks.

I know of at least one case where, when the disk is formatted at
1024 bytes/sector, track 0 is actually 128 bytes per sector.  You
might wish to check with the 1791 (I think that's whats in the CCS)
controller chip specs for the track format.  Also, try some of the
utility programs that should rely on the disk parameter block.  They 
are generally considered operable regardless of disk density.  Some
of these are DU (A disk hacking utility), and SAP (sort and pack
directory).  Be sure to use the latest versions and test them on
non-critical disks.

Good luck,

I no this is possible because IBM sells software that does it (without

service routine never gets called, that is, not until I run another

In addition to what lauren pointed at, let's take the case that
apparently caused a lot of flack: the reselling of various versions of
Ron Cain's small C compiler. In most cases, the resellers have taken
the compiler, extended it, and are reselling the result. These people
want to be paid for that work, and I can't say that I blame them.
Especially those who credit Ron (which some do in their advertising).

An analogous situation exists for software that you pay for. If you've
looked into getting source to one of the OEM Eunices, you here things
like "Well, we want $6000 for it, and we can only sell it if you
already have a Western source license."  Once again, these people want
to get paid for there work. Since they started with something they paid
for, nobody bitches. I don't see that what they are doing is all that
different from what is being done to public domain software.

An apparently little known fact about CP/M is that ANYtime a
program is doing console output through the BDOS, the user can
interrupt the program and return to the CCP by typing ^S^C.
The ^S pauses the printout, at which time the BDOS listens for
the resume character.  If the user types anything except a ^C,
the program will continue; otherwise, the BDOS will perform
a warm boot by jumping to location zero.  This means that the
BDOS and CCP will be reloaded and thus reinitialized in their
entirety.  The CCP, of course, performs its console output
by calling location 5, just like any applications program.

I am trying to remember where the BDOS stores the current User
number.  I recall that it is stored in location 4 along with
the current drive.  The question is whether a warm boot causes
the BDOS to initialize the User number, or your BIOS is zeroing
location 4 as part of its warm boot.

Anyone got a fix/answer for what appears to be a bug in the USER # feature?

The test condition is:

   o Set user number to some non-zero value

   o TYPE a text file under that user number

   o Sometime during that typeout use the ^S to stop output

   o Now type ^C to abort to monitor 

You get the prompt back just fine, but you are now under USER 0.

Other things generate the same result.  If I run XSUB under SUBMIT (or
SUPERSUB) when it terminates I am still in the same user number.  But
the next thing I do returns me to user 0.

I have tried this on several machines, under CP/M 2.2 both with the
regular CCP and one I have modified somewhat, and with and without
the DR patch for ^S.

Does anyone have information about file/record locking
facilities in cp/m or mp/m.

I'm thinking about some hardware which might be able to
dip into cp/m's file system and do things like:

   - print files without host support
   - store and retrieve files and file pieces
     from a network without interrupting the host cpu.

I'd appreciate any ideas, references, or random thoughts.

Thanks,

Re:   Epson Printers(long message)

Well it seems that nobody has a New Epson...they now come with an
EXTREMELY well written manual.  In addition to a tutorial style which
is very well written there is an excellent Appendix section which has
everything I could every ask for.  Just a sampling:

Appendix B - Control Codes: ALL!  of the control codes are listed.

Appendix R - GRAFTRAX+ ROM Set Installation Instructions: Do you
believe they actually tell you how to install the GRAFTRAX+
EPROMS(that's right - Epson uses EPROMS not ROMS - 3 2716s to be
exact).  This installation procedure will allow you to upgrade ANY
MX80, MX80F/T, or MX100 to have GRAFTRAX+.  I have an original MX80
and an older MX100(GRAFTRAX not +) which I have now upgraded and they
work fantastically!...To get copies of the EPROMS I just popped out
the ones from the new MX100(they are socketed) and copied them.

The options available are really nice...I would like to know what is
the reason for wanting to use the 128 ASCII character set for the
MX80F/T-what character should be printed for control-B for instance?

I have had no difficulty printing on an Epson MX80F/T in both
upper and lower case.  Can you describe in more detail the problem
you're having with lower case characters?

As for extended character sets, Pacific Software Systems offers CPM
software to support Epson printing using multiple proportionally
spaced fonts and user definition of additional characters and fonts.
Printing is at full Epson resolution (~25000 dots/sq. in.) which is
much better than the normal Epson fonts.

Subject:  Re:  ZDDT is not a simulator

        Good point ... I hadn't really used ZDT in moving thru  a
ROM.   If it uses the breakpoint-setting technique of instruction
execution, which would include setting one break  point  after  a
jump  and one at the jump address for a conditional branch unless
it was intelligent enough to examine the PSW flags  to  set  only
one  breakpoint, then it performs no simulation, but it still has
to perform some instruction interpretation.

        Also, are you talking about ZDT or ZDDT?  I haven't heard
of ZDDT.

        Finally, the point of the message was to say  that  these
debuggers are definitely NOT emulators.  I think the term "emula-
tor" is overworked and people have lost track of the meaning  ...
emulation involves microcode which actually examines and executes
instructions for one processor on the  architecture  of  another.
Refer  to any good text in computer architecture to see my point.
For those not familiar with the  concept  of  microcode,  we  are
talking  about gate-level (for horizontal microcode) or function-
level (for vertical microcode) instructions  which  are  executed
within  a  CPU  to interpret and execute the machine language in-
structions.  Several machines, such as the  VAX  11/780  and  PDP
11/60,  are  microprogrammable by the user (some "tricks" have to
be used by the VAX user to do this, tho), and the nature  of  the
machine-language  instructions recognized and executed by the CPU
can be changed.

ZDDT does not simulate instructions, it executes them.  One by one it
displays the instruction to be executed, and the current registers.  Then
it breakpoints the instruction after the one to be executed and executes it.
A good way to prove this is to try to single step some code in a rom.

Public domain software is exactly that;  anyone may use it for any
purpose!  If the author did not intend that it should be used
commercially,  then it should have been copyrighted with permission
granted for all non-commercial use.  Note that in this case, it is NOT a
public domain item!

I see no problems with someone that sells public domain software. This
person could be performing a service;  not everyone has knowledge of, nor
access to, such software.  In this case, what the customer is buying is
actually the convenience of not having to hunt for the items in
question.

The seller of public domain items may identify them as such, but is not
actually required to do so.  To keep customers happy, it is probably
good business sense to provide this notification.

The seller of any software (public domain or not) does have an
obligation under the standard "implied warranty" that the product sold
is fit for its intended use.  In general, while it does not have to 
meet any specific performance requirements, it has to try to do what is
claimed of it by the seller.  (ie; a payroll program must actually do
payrolls).  Thus, the seller of public domain software now incurs this
obligation while the author who placed it into the public domain does
not. This is another (theoretical) service that you are purchasing when
you buy public domain software.

All of the above comments are not an endorsement of the practice, but
just my personal opinions.  Discussion is welcome.

We are looking for a DBMS for micros that run under CP/M.  Specifically, we
are looking at dBase II, Condor, and MDBS.  I'd appreciate comments from anyone
who has used/uses one of these DBMSs, letting me know their opinions about it.
Thanks.

Via:  Ucb-C70; 19 Jul 82 10:03-EDT

I don't see the purpose in what you suggest:  putting  some  sort
of minimal system in the first two system tracks of the diskette,
and having it boot a more complete BIOS.  I will assume  for  the
moment  that we are talking about booting a double density system
from an 8" drive.

The approach I've taken is fairly simple.  When  booting  from  a
single  density  diskette, I do boot a fairly minimal system.  It
only has single density disk read/ write  routines,  and  doesn't
have my modem support in it.  Actually, I rarely boot from single
density any more.  The reason that a BIOS  on  a  single  density
disk has to be so small is obvious.

On the other hand, when booting off of a double density diskette,
I  have  plenty  of room to make my BIOS as fancy as I please (4K
approx).  Still, if I needed more space for my BIOS, I would just
take  an  extra system track, giving me more than 10K for a BIOS.
Unless the world has changed between now and when I first brought
up my double density system, there is no standard for double den-
sity 8" CP/M diskettes (or 5 1/4" either).  In any case, my  BIOS
uses the last byte of the first sector in track 0 to indicate the
diskette type, and which set of parameter tables to  use  when  I
log the drive in.  Adding another type to support *your* standard
would be quite easy; convincing you to record a funny  number  in
the  last byte of the first sector in track 0 might be a bit more
difficult.

Subject: Public domain programs in commercial packages

Via:  Ucb-C70; 17 Jul 82 16:54-EDT


I am currently completing the development of a package that acts
as a powerful extension to the programming environment of CP/M
systems.  In doing so, I have spent about eighteen months developing
both a new language, a shell, some really neat utilities and so
on.  

However, there are also some very nice pieces of software that I would
like to use, after I modify them, as additional useful utilities in
my package.  These are not products I am selling on their own right,
nor are they what people will be buying my package for.  They are
simply additional pieces of software that I wish to have available
for purchasers.

In order to be fair to both the writers of the initial public domain
software, as well as buyers of my package, I intend to do the
following.  First, if I know who originally wrote the software,
I will attempt to contact him and get permission for inclusion.
Secondly, ALL of the public domain software will be listed in the
documentation as follows:

	The following files are being provided as an aid to the
	user of the Hope System.  They are programs that are
	in the public domain.  In some cases they have been 
	modified to be more consistent with this package, but
	they are available elsewhere at little or no cost.  They
	do not influence the selling price of this package in
	any way.

Program		Description	Original Author		Source
=====================================================================
Blah76		Example Pgm	John Jones		Sig/M

I think that this is the most equitable way for the purchasers of 
my package to get the best of both the commercial and public
domains.

I would greatly appreciate commentary.

Thanks,

MIT has done up the portable C compiler for the 8086 and the 68000.
There is a good portion of an MSDOS library for the 8086 version
(maybe there is even more now).  the 68000 cross compiler is what
stanford is using for software development on the SUN processor.
You need a unix license for these, contatct Chris Terman (CJT) at MIT
for mor details.

Gene:  TSC at SRI has versions of this software running on their
	VLSI vax (SRI-JOYCE).  See /usr/src/cmd/c68000, and/or

Re:   10MEG Hard disk and my SDS system
 
     I recently ordered a complete Winchester system from ASC Associates.
It uses a 12.6Meg Miniscribe Drive, a smart SASE(sp?) interface, and an
S100 port addressed board.  It appears that it will fit nicely with my
SD system from a hardware standpoint.  Where I'm going to run into problems
is the software.  According to rumors (well founded), SD's BIOS left a lot
to be desired for correctness, efficency, and clarity.  ASC will be supplying
software on the disc and the listing of the bios that should be included to
make the drive functional.  Also they will be including a ROM Boot.  Do you
have any ideas on:

    1) A resource to get a GOOD SD BIOS for VERSAFLOPPY I

    2) A modification to make the disk look like the disk to be logically
separated into 2 or more drives?

    3) Someone interested in these drives for $1995 quantity one, and $1887
for 3 or more.

    4) Someone to train an old dog like me in a few of this less obvious
pieces of information.  
 
     If you would please give me a call, I would appreciate it greatly.

Hi --

        Large-scale software development  environments  like  you
would  prefer  to  use  certainly do exist, and, to my knowledge,
they are in the public domain.  While I was going to Grad  School
at  the U of Illinois, Urbana, one of the other grad students had
designed a "universal cross-assembler" which ran  on  our  DEC-10
under  TOPS-10.  This program, written in PASCAL, would accept as
input a "universal" assembly language source file and the name of
a  processor target file and assemble the source for the particu-
lar target.  We would then download from the 10 to the target and
run  (Intel  Hex  Format object).  When I left, the program would
assemble for the 8080, Z80, 6800, 6502, TI9900,  and  a  host  of
other micros (I think 10-15 micros total).

        You may wish to contact the Dept of CS at U  of  Illinois
for details.

I have every intention of running CP/M on my next machine, be it a
68000, 16032, iapx-432, 80286, or whatever else comes along. An
8080/z80 emulator will fit nicely in one Unix process on any of the
above. That way, not only do I get to run the nice, free software
available for CP/M, I can run ALL of it, plus the not-free stuff I am
currently running.

As for speed, the people at ERG claim a 2Mhz z80 equivalent for their
emulator (runs under their FORTH system), and it looks like a good
compiler (or assembler hacker) should be able to turn an NMhz 68000
into an N/3Mhz z80. Now, Motorola is making noises about 12 Mhz (and
faster, I would guess) 68000's, so you should be able to get as muchh
raw CPU out of said emulation as most people have on their z80.
However, when you consider that the I/O will go through the 68000, the
results should be NICE!

As for CP/M standalone: if CP/M-68 (or whatever) can run a Unix
emulation in a single process, I'd be willing to look at it. But
something tells me that this will never happen.

A final note: hopefully, when I get new hardware (next year or so) some
of the truly nice stuff (as opposed to the scuz that is Unix) will be
avaible. I'm refering to things like Eden, Smalltalk, etc.

Ithaca Intersystems (and others, from what I understand) have find what I
regard as a VERY nice approach to the problem of their BIOS not fitting on
the system tracks of a disk. They use a two level boot.

This works like so: Onto the system tracks of your disk goes a stripped
down version of the BIOS, with the some command hard-wired into the CCP
command buffer. This command (called startup by Intersystems)
overwrites the old BIOS, and then jumps to the cold boot entry point.
Viola, the new bios is running.

The advantage of this is twofold. First, you can have a HUGE BIOS (the
Intersystems caching BIOS is about 9K); second, you get to test your
new BIOS by invoking a com file, with no other magic.

The stripped down BIOS should be something useable. Instersystems takes
out the disk write routines. That way, if it doesn't boot the second
level, you can look around and see what went wrong.

I've found a bug in the preprocessor of BDS C that you're probably already
aware of, but just in case I'll mention it.  I have version 1.44 of BDS C (the
accounting people haven't gotten around to getting me the latest version yet).
If you have a string that is terminated by a backslash-newline sequence, and
resumed and terminated on the next line, any macros found after the string in
the next line are not recognized.  Example:

	printf("This is a string that is continued \
on the next line.\n");   x = CONSTANT;    /* CONSTANT will not be expanded. */

This is a fairly easy trap to fall into; when I was writing my C compiler
preprocessor, I had the same problem.  It gets really tricky trying to keep
track of comments and strings when you're expanding macros.

I am looking for software development tools for micros such as the
8086, 68000, and PDP-11/23.  The tools should run on a mini or
mainframe such as Prime, VAX, IBM, or DEC-20.

The language of choice is C; so the critical item for the development
environment is a cross compiler for C targeted for the above micros.
Other nice elements would be emulators, debuggers, and the such that
run on the development host machines as well as on the micros them
selves.

The target operating systems are DEC's POS (nee RSX-11) for the
Professional 325 and 350, MS-DOS for the IBM PC and etc., CPM-86, MPM,
and Unix on the 68000.

Such an integrated software development environment probably isn't
presently available.  But surely some of the major pieces are here
now.  (I hope.)

By the way, what are the 'big boys' doing for large scale software
development?  Surely places like Microsoft and Digital Research are
not using the crummy programming environments currently available on
the popular micros to produce major new systems, particularly when the
systems are targeted for more than one family of micro CPU and OS
combination.

Subject:  Re:  A z-80 emulator for the 8080/z80

Eliot,

        First of all, do you want an EMULATOR or a SIMULATOR?  To
me,  Emulation implies changing the microcode of one processor to
make it look like another.  The VAX 11/780, for instance,  has  a
PDP  11/70  emulation  mode, in which case the User MicroControl-
Store is programmed to recognize PDP 11/70 machine code.

        If you want a simulator, that's basically what DDT,  SID,
ZDT,  and ZSID are.  They simulate execution of machine code by a
processor and allow you to watch  what  happens  while  the  code
runs.   You can watch registers change and even examine what hap-
pens to memory between each instruction.  The EM8080 program  you
mention is what I would call a simulator.

        Note: You HAVE to have  a  microprogrammable  machine  in
order to perform emulation.  The AMD2900 bit-slice chips would be
an example.  There are several GP-machines, such  as  the  GenRad
2900  (number correct?) and the Tektronix 85xx-series.  They pro-
vide cross-software capability like what you are probably looking
for, but they are probably outside the price range you are in.  I
have not seen any public-domain simulator for a Z80 which runs on
an  8080  ...  ZDT  and  ZSID both run on a Z80 for a Z80 and are
rather complete simulations.

                                        Rick

Via:  Mit-Mc; 16 Jul 82 10:41-EDT

I am having a problem with Mince on MP/M-II that I can't figure out how to fix
and I wonder if anyone else has any idea (I may have fixed this at one point
but can't remember how or if I, in fact, did).

I am running MP/M-II on an H89 with Magnolia's 128K board.  I have half of
the Z67 as my A disk.  I have a MINCE.SWP in user 0, SYS, RW.  All works
fine in CP/M.  In MP/M, when I try to run from (e.g.) user 12, when swapping
gets done, I get the BDOS error message that a write is being attempted to
a file opened R/O.  Reading the MP/M documentation, it appears that doing
a default open on a file in user 0, even if the file is RW, the open is done
R/O.

I tried all four compatibility attributes even though the documentation didn't
make it sound as though they were the problem and, in fact, they didn't do
the trick.

Anyone have any ideas?

I haven't seen any discussion in this list about DEC's new personal
computers, so I thought I'd describe one.  Please excuse me if this
material has already been covered.

    Last May, DEC announced four personal computer products.  The 
Rainbow 100 is a CP/M machine.  The DECmate II is a word processor.
The Professional 325 and 350 are, well, I guess I'd call them
personal workstations.  I assume the Rainbow 100 is of most interest
to this list, so I will only describe it here.  It has the lowest price
of the four.  I will send a description of the Professional 325 and 350
to Info-Micro.


    Here is a summary of the major features of the Rainbow 100.  
Everything mentioned below comes in the standard configuration.

Processors:
    Contains both a Z80 (8-bit) and an 8088 (16-bit).
Operating System:
    Called CP/M-86/80, it will run programs developed for both CP/M-80 and
    CP/M-86, automatically detecting which processor to run them on.
Mass Storage:
    5 1/4" dual disk drive with 400Kbytes (formatted) per disk.
Memory:
    64Kbytes RAM.
Monitor:
    12" screen.  Selectable 80x24 or 132x24 characters displayed.
Keyboard:
    Super thin "ergonomic" keyboard with VT100-type keypad, arrow keys,
    and 18 special function keys (8 user-definable).
Packaging:
    Separate monitor, keyboard and system box (latter houses floppy drive).
Communications:
    Printer port and RS232C port on system box.


    There are also a number of options available, including the below:

Second dual disk drive (also housed in system box).
5Mbyte 5 1/4" Winchester disk (packaged as a separate box).
64Kbytes or 192Kbytes add-on RAM boards.
Bitmap graphics (512x256x2).
Color monitor.
Dot matrix printer that can reproduce screen graphics.
VT100 emulation software.
Basic, C, text editors, spreadsheet programs, etc.


    Now for the bottom line.  The basic system is priced at $3500 (!).
They will be marketed through ComputerLand, Hamilton/Avnet, and directly
from Digital Equipment Corp.  Volume manufacturing starts in October,
so you can't buy one yet, but the ComputerLand stores are supposed to
have demo machines fairly soon.  If you want more information, ask me, 
or else call 1-800-DIGITAL.

I know you are all saying, 'What is this guy on?!?! What the #$%&

it isn't quite that simple, but that is what I need.  A Z-80
emulator written for the 8080 or Z-80, I am not picky at this point.
In Dr. Dobb''s Number 28 September 1978 Volume 3,Issue 8, there is an
article and source for EM8080, an 8080 emulator for the 6800.
I don't know 6800 at all.  I could figure it out with the help
of a friend, but anyway I figured, 'Why re-invent the wheel'.
Am I re-inventing the wheel in this case?  Is there such a monster
out there? HELP!

To:  info-cpm at Mit-Ai
Via:  Mit-Mc; 15 Jul 82 20:34-EDT

Apple-II Modem V2.18A, modified by Calcoyannides and highly recommended,
has a data capture mode which is very useful for moving files off of
timeshare systems and onto your personal floppies.  Going the other way
is a little more work, to wit:

1. Find out what slot your MM-II is in (you put it there, so you should
remember).


2. Look up on pages 2-4 and 2-5 of your manual and find out the "device
name" of the slot your MM-II is in.  In my case, it is in slot 2 because
my BIT3 board is in 3, and therefore is called the PUN.

3. Make sure you have a copy of PIP either on your Modem boot diskette
or your file diskette.  I find it a good practice to put a copy of PIP
on every boot diskette I make.

4. Use Modem to log into your favorite big dinosaur.

5. Place said dinosaur's text editor into text input mode

6. Hit ctl-e, which will kick you out of Modem and into CP/M.

7. Do a PIP with the "device name" of your MM-II as the destination.  In
my case this is PIP PUN:=B:FOO or some such.  Wait for the prompt.

8. When you get a CP/M prompt, do MODEM T to put yourself back in
terminal mode.  Then perform whatever saurian incantations are
neccessary to make the input buffer a file.

To:   info-cpm at BRL
Via:  Office-2; 15 Jul 82 12:03-EDT

Well my case where I don't boot the Morrow supplied BIOS is similar to 
trying to run some other system.  I am ,of course, using
the software in the ROM as I dont ever read the morrow disk.  Any simple boot
procedure is possible with any old disk layout since there is
no particular dependency built into the controller.
 
However,...The Rom software seems to have a peculiar bug that causes a 1k block
of memory beyond the advertized 2k of the controller to become contaminated.
I cannot locate anyting in the code to support this assumption that it is the
software.  It could be a hardware problem but seems to be restricted to the
single 1k block of memory immediately above the morrow RAM.  Anyone
every heard of such a problem with the Morrow?.
 
The interace to the ROM disk routines seems easy enough.  To boot a strange 
system requires only a 128 byte cold boot routine that is loaded into the 
controller RAM by the BOOT subroutine. The standard entry point for
this boot is described in the manual.  From then on it is the designer's
game
 
Peace and thanks for any help.

Dr. Godbout called today to ask that I tell all who've learned
from the net about the new BIOS that it will be available
sometime this Fall.

They do not release anything without extensive testing and they
do not have the final form yet, since my friend Tony keeps
adding features.

This becomes one of those "it'll be great when you finally get
it" stories, and that I can't help; I'm using a version, but
they are not ready to release that yet because they keep adding
to it.
	The good news is that it WILL be  available, and it does
nearly everything you'd like a BIOS to do: able to run Warp
drive, does not blow up when there is no disk in the drive, can
run both 8" anbd 5 1/4" disks; and Tony now believes he can make
the Godbout controller  format 5 1/4 to ALMOST ANY format,
including CCS, Osborne, Trs-80, and indeed anything except the
bit-controlled ones like Apple.  This latter is NOT promised,
but it does look as if he will have it.
	More when I know ,ore; and sorry if I got someone's
hopes up.  Please DO NOT call Dr. Godbout about this; when it's
available, we will let ou know.  Thanks for the interest, and
wish the testing were done already so it could go out.
	To forestall inquiries: I do NOT know how one becomes a
test site; and I am told they have plenty already.

It strikes me that something that is Copyrighted can not be in the

distributed free of charge. This does not imply that said articles

Via:  Mit-Mc; 15 Jul 82 0:00-EDT

It turned out that I simply didn't apply the originally suggested fix
in the "right" place.  (I put it in the REMSTAT routine.)  The problem
with MODEM and friends is the garbage collection that is done after a
block is sent: it does a direct call to REMIN (or more likely in your
implementations, just an IN DPORT), twice.  That is where the check of
the xmit buffer was not done.  The last character sent, which should
have been the checksum byte in my case, ended up being replaced by the
last character received - the initial NAK!

Thus, the real and normally superfluous fix is to always check the
status of the xmit buffer before reading the receive buffer...

To correct the previous rumor: it is a second-source supplier of the
2661 who is holding orders pending a fix to a "masking problem."

I think the chief ripoff in selling public domain software is not the
fact that it is being sold, but the fact that the sellers apparently
do not identify the software as such.  If I take someone else's code
and modify it, I have no right to claim that it is "my code".  If I
don't even modify it, the situation is even more obviously stealing
(morally, at least, if not legally).  Of course, I know why the people
who sell public domain software don't mention that it is public domain -
people would be less likely to buy it if they knew that they could get
it for free.  Perhaps this is where a copyright notice would help.
Someone could still sell the code, but failing to include the copyright
notice would surely be a violation of the law.  And even if a buyer
didn't find out beforehand that the code was public domain, I bet he'd
(she'd/it'd) get rather bugged to see a notice "copyright 1981 J. Hacker -
this code is in the public domain" printed out when he runs the code
he just paid $200 for.  Maybe (I hope) bugged enough to take his business
to a more honest vendor.

Via:  Sri-Unix; 14 Jul 82 17:29-EDT

Alan Bomberger's message reminds me of something I always wished I'd
understood...how my Morrow 2D BIOS actually boots.  I am using
Morrow's CP/M 2.2 implementation by Bobby Dale Gifford (of G&G
Engineering fame).  This BIOS checks the sector density (128, 256,
512, or 1024) and the single/double-sidedness of the drive when the
drive is first selected, and an appropriate DPH is selected
accordingly.  That part is relatively straightforward.  Another detail
is that during the booting process a standardized copy of the firmware
is loaded into the controller RAM, and all subsequent BIOS calls to
the firmware actually call the code in RAM; the ROM is never used!
Apparently there were many old revision boards out there with
various levels of bug fixes in ROM, so they decided to bypass the
problem by never using the ROM at all.

Those of you who have this BIOS have probably marvelled at the long
list of sectors in the beginning of the code similar to the
traditional Digital Research list of CCP/BDOS/BIOS memory pages and
corresponding disk sectors.  Things in ABOOT.ASM are not much clearer.
One section of code is designed to fit exactly into a 256-byte sector,
the next fits into a 512-byte sector, etc.  The exact order of events
for booting from a disk of a given sector size is not explained, nor
is the procedure for copying ABOOT to the disk.  One reason this is of
interest is that the information would help in creating a bootable
version of another operating system, such as MARC (to take a totally
random example).  Has anyone deciphered any of this and would like to
shed some light on it?

A recent experience left me feeling once again that technology is far
ahead of the human ability to cope.  I ordered a Morrow 2D controller from
a local store after discussing with a salesperson that I wanted to use
it on my NorthStar Horizon without displacing the NorthStar disks.  I had
written my own BIOS and added phantom signals for the NorthStar controller
so I was using the top 8 k of memory.  No sweat ..We ordered a ROM at F000
and I was assured that several people at the store had done the same thing..
 
It finally arrived and I studied the literatur, configured the board, plugged 
it in... of course it did not work.  Hours later I determined that
Phantom did not work properly.  I called the store... Oh yes, phantom
doesn't work!  Since I had discussed this with the salesperson and the board
came configured with phantom enabled, I was disgusted.  I modified my
external phantom generator to include the morrow range and got the controller
to boot.
 
I noticed that if I did not boot the Morrow at least once, I was not able
to use it.  NOWHERE in the manual, that seems incredibly detailed, was
it mentioned that certain areas of morrow RAM must be initialized and that
the controller chip is not reset at RESET.  I copied some code from the
Boot portion of the ROM and am on the air.
 
I wish that computer stores would charge up front for "aid" instead
of chargin everybody a premium to pay salespeople to teach BASIC
to potential customers.  The people at the store were not able to
help and even supplied misleading information.  End of Flame.

I just had an installation and service call on my new TRS-80 Mod 16.
It turns out that it runs memory-mapped video programs like
wordstar, vedit, etc just fine as configured for Pickles and
Trout CP/M for the Model II.  The problem was a defective Z-80
board in the Model 16, and rumor has it that a few of the early
production Model 16's all had the same defect, allegedly caused
by a couple of bad jumpers.  The problem only shows up when you
try to access the screen via Pickles and Trout calls.

I spoke to Greg Pickles today and he tells me that they are ready
to release their cp/m for the Mod 16 in Mod II mode, now.  It
will support both sides of the Tandon drive(s).  They are only
waiting for the documentation to be xeroxed.

BTW-There is an outfit in Oregon advertising a converter program
to get TRSDOS Model II Visicalc running under P&T cp/m and also TRSDOS
basic (a little different than Microsoft cp/m MBASIC) running under
P&T cp/m.  They both work fine; I bought them.  They also have a backup
and a disk format utility that copy Pickles and Trout cp/m disks, 
including all system tracks from any disk to a blank one.  That saves
a lot of time when using a modified cp/m, as, for example ZCPR modified
CCP.  The backup is also very fast (45 sec for a full copy) since
it goes straight to the disk ports, avoiding cp/m.

I don't think the suggested "restriction" notices will serve much
purpose.  I *believe* that most such attempts at "restrictive"
definitions of "public domain" have failed when they reached court.

It's not even clear that the situation is even all that simple.
If there are piles of public domain software around, and someone decides
to collect various sorts of programs into USEFUL collections, why shouldn't
they be able to sell them?  Not everyone can afford to work for free!
If you admit that selling is OK, how can you say that THIS price is ok but
THIS price is a ripoff?  I don't understand how such determinations can
be anything but subjective -- and good luck making subjective determinations
like that work in a courtroom!

Another point:  Say that someone has a big program (say a database program)
that they want to sell (they've written it themselves).  Just to make
things easier for the users of their software, they decide to include
a number of related public domain programs with their package.  Obviously,
the whole thing has a single price.  How do you divide out the non-
public from the public-domain software in a single distribution of this
type?

Re:   Directory Utility in BDS C for CP/M 2.x

AR36:CPM;CDIR C on MC:
--------------------

	CDIR.C - A CP/M 2.2 utility that allows operators to switch
between user numbers by specifiying a name, rather than a number. This
has the effect of simulating sixteen named directories in a convenient
manner.

	When used in conjunction with ZCPR, and DUPUSR, CDIR can make
CP/M a lot more livable until an operating system with a nice
directory structure arrives.

	CDIR.C - (C) 1982 by Barry A. Dobyns.
	Commercial use (sales) of this program is prohibited,
	however, private use by individuals is encouraged.

[Details can be found in front of the source file itself - FJW]

[FJW - Other comments from Barry:]

	As best as I can determine, CP/M loses the user number set from
within an application program iff the program terminates with a warm
boot instead of a ret. In other words, in the code below, the program
on the left leaves one in user 15, as expected. The program on the
right leaves one in whatever the previously selected user area was.

          ;I win                        ;I lose
          ;                             ;
          org  100H                     org  100H
          mvi  c,32                     mvi  c,32
          mvi  e,15                     mvi  e,15
          call 5                        call 5
          ret                           jmp  0

	Anyone know why?? Therefore, CDIR must be run over with NOBOOT so
that it returns and does not boot, otherwise it isn't very useful.

I second smb's solution, if not as a solution then at least as a good idea:
anyone who puts software in the public domain should attach to it, in a form
as likely as possible to stay with it, a note regarding desireable uses of
the software. This might not prove particularly enforceable legally, but
at least there would be more pressure on the opportunists to not consider
a ripoff. An example: On my BDS C distributiton disks, there is a lot of code
(both in C and in assembly language) that I essentially think of as in the
public domain. That is why I stuffed it all into the cpm bds-c archives. But
I didn't put any copyright notice on it or anything; subsequently, my code
has shown up in places like the Supersoft C library, and naturally I don't
get any credit for it! So, I wish I had put copyright notices. Sigh.

There is a solution that's simple in principle, if not enforcement.
If you write such a program yourself, include a copyright notice, and
some phrase like "permission is granted to anyone to reproduce and
distribute this program to anyone else, but not for direct commercial
gain", or some such.  See, for example, the notice at the start of

To: INFO-MICRO at BRL, INFO-CPM at BRL
Via:  Mit-Mc; 12 Jul 82 23:46-EDT

So far, I've discovered that these chips do not like to have their
recv buffer read while the xmit buffer is still draining.  The fix to
that one is simple (if your chip exhibits this problem of garbled
input - not all do): just check both bits (03H) when checking input
status.

That's all well and good.  Now for the strange part: when using a
program like MODEM to send out a file, the last byte of the block,
which normally should be the checksum byte, is the NAK received up
front to kick off the process!  Looks like the xmit drain problem in
reverse, doesn't it?  Again, not all of the chips have this problem -
and the problem doesn't appear to be run specific either.

Last I heard (rumor), Signetics has withdrawn the 2661.  I have not
heard about the 2651.  The 2651 is used in the Thomas Engineering
QLC-100, four-port card.  The 2661 is used in the Action DPC-180 and
DPC-100 cards.

If anyone uses either of these chips and has run across the second
problem, and discovered a solution, I would like to hear about it
immediately!

Thanks,
Frank

What makes crypt.c better or more desirable than Ward Christensen's

I, too, am rather bugged with what's been happening recently.  In regards
to the software tools that Jerry has been publicizing in his column in
BYTE, I would have liked to have seen him mention the alternative of
being able to download this software from a number of RCPM systems around
the country.  I think that publicizing these RCPM systems will serve to
put even more software into the public domain.

I'm not totally familiar with the Workman disks, so I do have a question
that might shed some light:  are these disks public domain themselves?  If
our computer club were to purchase them (as it does the CP/M UG, SIGM, and
others), can it distribute them to our members?

Something along the same line that bugs me a *LOT* more is the number of
people who took the Small-C compiler that Ron Cain put into the public
domain, put a few improvements in it, and sell it s their own.  A friend
bought a compiler that is labeled Copyright Quality Computer
Systems.  I think it cost around $100, and is nothing more than an
enhanced Small-C.

It boils down to a matter of cost and ownership.  If I release a program
that I wrote to public domain, I don't want *ANYONE* making money off of
it.  Period.  I also don't want people to enhance it and call it
their own.  Period.

 Hi Folks,
  Has anyone ever considered or experimented with using a Atari 400/800
  from a CPM based system? With the price of a Atari 400 dropping below
  $300, it seems that the 400 would make a nice peripheral on a CPM
  system. Could the ATARI OS (or DOS) be modified so that it accepts input 
  from a RS232 port, instead of from the keyboard? Could I read in ATARI 
  disks from CPM? Could I download programs into the ATARI, and then run 
  them? I would think that a 6502 cross assembler would be available under 
  CPM. If anyone has tried this, or has comments/suggestions, I would
  appreciate your response.

  Tnx, Ed

Well, it's there correctly this time.

The file is in ar35:cpm;crypt c  on the mit-mc machine.

The program best works with ascii text files. Meaning that if
there is a large amount of zeroes in your binary file,
the key can be easily guessed due to the encryption method.
It's simple, and it works.

Incidentally, there has been considerable talk recently about the problem

For those of you not previously aware of it, I maintain a master list

   <ALMSA>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT

   For ARPANET users, OFFICE-3 supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS
   login within FTP, with any password.

To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, I have
established a mailing list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  I do
not propose to send copies of the list itself to the world at large,
but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend to FTP the updated
versions when updated, I will send a brief notice that a new version
is available.  For those counterparts at internet sites who maintain
or redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, etc.)
and can't reach the master by ARPANET FTP, I will send out the
complete new file.  I do \not/ intend to send file copies to
individual users, either ARPANET or internet; our system is fairly
heavily loaded, and we can't afford it.

There is no particular pattern to the update frequency of INTEREST-
GROUPS.TXT; I will occasionally receive a burst of new mailing-lists
or perhaps a single change of address for a host or mailing-list
coordinator, and then have a long period with no changes.

To get on the list, send requests to ZELLICH@OFFICE-3, \not/ to the

JWP@MIT-AI 07/04/82 05:10:20 Re: Deblocking
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-AI
     Up until recently,  I had taken the deblocking algorithm for 
granted  while  doing some extensive (commercial) work  with  the 
BIOS/monitor for my SuperBrain.   Without much thought and a  few 
patches, I just inserted the DR supplied code.

     With  all  this  talk of problems with the  code  lately,  I 
decided  that I should sit down and really look at what it  does.  
I  was  especially  interested because  of  a  problem  sometimes 
encountered  while doing a wildcard file transfer in PIP where it 
would  lose its place in the directory and end up  skipping  half 
the files.   Checking for a patch in the BDOS,  the lack of which 
might  cause  such a condition,  I found that the patch had  been 
implemented  and so my illusive gremlin was still at  large  (and 
remains so today).

     I finally was able to comprehend how the blocking/deblocking 
algorithm  worked  and found nothing out of order except that  in 
the 2.0 release of the algorithm, DR neglected to clear UNACNT in 
READ.

     One thing that gets me is that while the read algoritms  are 
good and serve their purpose well,  it seems that the write logic 
is  a little lacking.   Would it be proper thinking to write only 
when  necessary (ie.  the way reads are done)?   Of  course,  the 
directory  write  can be used to force a  write.   This  approach 
seems  reasonable enough.   The only time data would be  lost  is 
when  either  a  cold boot is performed or the system  goes  down 
before the current buffer is written.   When you think about  it, 
entire  extents  are usually lost when this happens anyway  - the 
unwritten buffer wouldn't be missed unless you know how to use DU 
to  rebuild the extent.   Files would be closed with  the  forced 
(directory) write function (1).

NOTES:

1. Whether  a	program  exchange system is  accessible  by  an 
   a.l.d.s. (= alternative long-distance service) should be con-
   sidered  when  planning  to modem over long programs. Charges 
   on  SPRINT,  ITT/CITYCALL  and  MCI are  50-60% of  Ma Bell's
   regular  long distance rates.

2. Call-back systems are those where a computer and real people 
   share the same telephone line.   To contact the people, just 
   dial  &  let the phone ring until you  get  an  answer.   To 
   contact  the  computer:   (1) dial,	(2) let the phone  ring 
   once, (3) hang up just before the 2nd ring, & (4) re-dial.

3.  Note  that  the  212A/Vadic 1200 Baud modems  may  not  be 
   compatable  with  yours.    Most of the above  systems  are 
   using  Vadic 3451 Triple modems,  compatable with both Bell 
   and Vadic Standard.   Sign on the first time at 300 baud to 
   determine the system capabilities.    Note also that PMMI's 
   can sometimes be used above 300 baud with 1200 baud systems.

Does anyone have documentation for the MITS 88-2 SIO rev 0
serial IO card ?  I got one of these dinasaurs (REAL cheap)
with absolutly no information.  It has a 6850 style UART
chip and a plethora of pads marked with things like Mx, Nx,
Jx, Kx, Ix, Yx, Lx, and Zx (where there are several pads, with
x ranging from 1-4, 1-8, 1-12, or 1-16, depending on the letter).
I will gladly pay copying and postage charges to anyone who
can mail me directions on how to get this working...

Subj: XC C cross referencer
Via:  Ucb-C70; 3 Jul 82 7:19-EDT


there is a bug in the distribution of the XC c cross referencer program
distributed by the bds c users group. if an include file has disk name
prefix like "a:bdscio.h", xc says is cannot open "a". this is readily
cured by changing the function get_token(). add on more local char variable
called tmpchr2 and change tmpchr to tmpch1. change the test on g_flg
where if true, tmpchr1 = '.' and tmpchr2 = ':'. if false, then 
tmpchr1=tmpch2='_'. now change the following while loop to include
a test of c == tmpchr1 || c == tmpchr2 instead of the original c == tmpchr.
this just changes get_token's idea of what characters are valid in a file
name. now you can have dumby include files on your source disks while
keeping the valid updated header files on another disk.

Subject:  Using DC Hayes 80-103a modem with Z80

The following is forwarded from my RCPM.  Replies to author,
not me, please.

---forwarded file 80-103A.DCH---

Sinec I've never seen it mentioned anywhere, I'd like to
share the following information with all those who don't know:

The DC Hayes 80-103A modem was designed to run in an 8080
system. For some reason, they decided to use the upper 8
address bits to decode the ports. While that is fine with
8080 processors, it makes life miserable for those who upgrade
to a Z-80 CPU. The Z-80 normally puts the contents of the
accumulator on the upper 8 and the port address on the lower 8.
So if you don't have a Z-80 board that can be switched to
"8080 mode" you're out of luck, right?
WRONG!
Conversion to use the 80-103A with a Z-80 CPU is very simple
for input. Simply add the following instruction before every
input:    MVI A,PORT
That will put the port address in ACC.
For output it's more complicated, but the fact that I'm able to
use the board without problems is proof that it can be done.
just replace the OUT instruction this way:
Either: OUT MACRO PORT
            PUSH B
            MVI B,PORT
            MOV C,B
            DB 0EDH,79H ; Z-80 OUT A,(C)
            POP B
            MACND
Or, if you don't have a macro assembler, simply replace every
OUT instruction to a modem port with the above code.

I have successfully converted BYE77 and XMODEM this way and it
works fine. The slowdown due to more code being executed is
negligible.

Subject: CP/M Blocking and Deblocking
Via:  Ucb-C70; 2 Jul 82 8:57-EDT

Well, I found out why I was having difficulty...

WARNING!!!!! To all those who are implementing a BIOS that uses the Blocking/
Deblocking algorithms supplied by Digital Research!!!!!

While the bug that I found has been fixed in the copy of the algorithm supplied
in DEBLOCK.ASM on the CP/M distribution disk, DR did NOT update the CP/M 2.2
Alteration Guide! I was using the listing printed in the guide when I typed in
my BIOS, and did not think to check the copy on the file.  As it was, DR's fix
takes two instructions, while mine takes only 1, and mine is more efficient!

For those of you who are waiting with baited breath (phew!), my fix is as
follows:

filhst:
	;may have to fill the host buffer
	lda	sekdsk		; the desired sector is now the current sector
	sta	hstdsk
	lhld	sektrk
	shld	hsttrk
	lda	seksec
	sta	hstsec
	lda	rsflag		; need to read?
	ora	a
	cnz	readhst		; yes, if non-zero
	xra	a		; no pending write
	sta	hstwrt
	sta	unacnt		; <----- this is my modification - if we get
				; here, we can't still be within an unallocated
				; block.

Digital Research fixed the problem by clearing 'unacnt' EVERY time a read is
performed.  My fix allows you to read back the sector you just wrote, without
forgetting that you're within an unallocated block.  Hmmm... come to think of
it, my way of doing it may not be right, either.  What if you write the first
128 bytes of a sector in an unallocated block, and then read then second 128
bytes?  It seems to me that I'll get garbage... oh well, doing a preread on the
unallocated block, THEN returning the second 128 bytes will also give you
garbage, so I'm not going to worry about it.

Actually, neither solution is optimal.  What if you write a sector in an
unallocated block, then go off and read something elsewhere on the disk, and
then come back to write the next sector in the unallocated block?  This happens
fairly often when you are copying a file from one place to another on the same
disk, but normally it happens so rarely that I didn't think it was worth the
trouble to implement.  In any case, my BIOS now works, so I'm happy...

I finally made the big step and got a controller that supports DD. Nice
to have 600K per disc (I have 801 Drives).  I did have my share of
problems getting my memory up to 4 MHZ and the disc controller working
with my Z80......but I did it.

	The only problem remaining is that I need help in creating a
double dens. disc that I can boot from. Currently I boot up a single
dens disc and then put in a double dens...then a Control C and I'm
there. The problem is the CCBIOS which supports the double dens
configurations is too big for tracks 0 and 1 when tracks 0 and 1 are
single dens., so I must put a single dens. version(of BIOS) on the boot
tracks.

	I did try to make tracks 0 and 1 double dens. and then patch
in CCBIOS(DD) but could not boot disc.......the info from CCS is scarce
and not very helpful......

	Is there anyone out there that can help me?

problem with your comments tho.  The problem with the crc's
was caused by OTERM writing an extra record when receiving.
Of course, this should not affect the operation of COM

OTERM.BUG  06/24/82   Tom McCormick.

OTERM.COM is very well documented, and an
outstanding effort by Michael Rubenstein.

I cannot get it to transfer correctly with
MODEM7 or XMODEM 3.9 at the other end. It
tansfers the files and says all is well,
but the CRCK's do not agree.  The .COM
files go nuts.

I have run about twenty trials, but no
luck. I have CRCK ver 4.2 at both ends.

Can someone ( M Rubenstein, perhaps)
furnish the correct CRCK for OTERM.COM?
Perhaps I have a corrupted copy.

In the mean time.... all you OS-1 users

Godbout/Compupro will shortly be supplying a new BIOS with their
equipment.  This was written by Tony Pietsch, and features
provisions for M (warp) drive, m (mini-floppy), as well as
driving the Godbout controller faster than anything we've seen
yet.  Alas they are removing Tony's builtin provision for the N
Drive (semi-disk) on the , sigh, reasonable grounds that they're
not responsible for providing software to support another
company's competing products.
	If you have an older Compupro you should  think about
getting the new BIOS, which ought to be available in perhaps a
month.  One nice feature: if you try to access a drive with no
disk in it, it says "Load the Drive, Stupid" instead of BDOS
error...
This impressed a couple of Compupro engineers no end last night
when they were over for a couple of hours and I demonstrated the
BIOS.  As always you get the source code.

	(NOTE: I have no commercial interest in this at all; but
I have seen a number of people go slightly mad because they
don't have the BIOS source, or can't do certain things, or get
BDOS errors when they shouldn't, and I conclude that one reason
I like my computer so much is that I seem to have awfully good
software; better than I knew until I saw what others put up

Re:   drive info

Keith,
	I should send this message to 'Bob Safranek' at 'ucbvax!pue-ee!rjs'
(if I only knew how to get MM to do it). This notice on the CPM bboard was
info on 'ollivetti' drives. Could you foreward this to him. Thanks in advance.

I purchased a 'new' 8" SD floppy drive (made by CDC) for $175 from a company
called 'Meshna' '(617) 595-2275'. The drive works great but there is a catch.
The motor for the drive requires 220v @50 HZ . The fix is: (1) they send you
a step up transformer 115 to 230 which works just fine. (2) the pulley
on the drive is reversable one side is 50HZ and the other is 60HZ.  So all
you do is flip it arround.  The last catch is that the 50 pin (io) edge
connector is different from the Sugart. I solved this by hacking the traces
on the drive (once I knew it worked) so that the signals now go to the 'right'
place on the 50 pin io connector.

	The DC voltages of the drive are 24v@1.3A and 5v@.8A. Also if you
find a problem (before you hack the traces on the drive) you can send the
pc board on the drive back to Meshna and they will send you a new one.
The controler I have is a Versa Floppy I (old but good).

	If you dont mind the hacking to get it working you can't match the
price $175.

Good luck to all,

I don't really have any further suggestions about using systems
in France in general...I believe that 2114s are available but a
bit more expensive, so again a few spares purchased here would
be helpful. Naturally, the quality of power systems varies from
place to place, and your colleagues can probably tell you if
they have had any trouble using computer equipment. If you are
going over to participate in one of the new government sponsored
computer research projects, there will probably be plenty of
technical help available by then for such problems.

Just uploaded mcar35:cpm;crypt c . It is a file encryption
ala unix's ``crypt'' utility, designed to allow people
to keep secrets from anyone and everyone, unless, of course,
someone guesses the key that the file was encrypted with.

One slight problem though, if you give a key on the
command line, it will be converted to UPPER case, and
if the file was encrypted with a key containing any
lower case characters, the file will be improperly
decrypted.
Enjoy!

Hi --

        I just  finished  uploading  Version  3.5  of  PRINT2  to
AR27:CPM  on  MIT-MC.  ASM, COM, and HEX files are uploaded.  The
only difference between 3.5 and 3.4 is that the built-in  support
package  of  3.4  has a bug in it which is corrected in 3.5.  For
those who did not install the clock routine and used 3.4,  PRINT2
could  not print (very well, to say the least) a file larger than
memory.  For those who did install the SPTTIME package, 3.5 users
should note no change over 3.4 (bug did not exist).

        Thanks to Frank Wancho for pointing out the problem.

Hi, again, Bruce.  Thanks for the message to Info-Cpm telling about the
bug yu found in the deblocking.  Is it clear that this is the revised
deblocking routine that has the bug, or is it possible you may have
the old version?  In any case, how about sending a few lines of code
including 3-4 before and after the area where you added the one
instruction?  Send it to Info-Cpm (our address is now BRL instead of
MIT-MC) so everyone can check theirs.  This is the first time I have
run into this problem, and I have a 10 megabyte hard disk with some
files as large as 200k that I have sucessfully edited without this
problem.  My CBIOS uses DR's deblocking.

Ah HAH!!! I found the problem! It IS a bug in the Digital Research-supplied
code.  If you write the lower 128 bytes of a 256-byte UNALLOCATED blocked
sector, everything is fine.  If you then decide to read or write a sector in
another block, everything is still fine; the original unallocated sector gets
written out correctly.  However, if you then decide to write the upper 128
bytes of the altered sector, the BIOS thinks it's still in the unallocated
block, and decides not to preread the original sector.  This causes you to
lose the first 128 bytes of the sector.  After wasting an entire day on this
problem, I now have a working BIOS.  It sure would be nice if Digital Research
would send a bug fix for this problem.  It only takes one instruction to fix...

Are there any known bugs in the sector blocking/deblocking algorithms
supplied by Digital Research with CP/M?  I don't mean the field patch that
DR distributes (the one you make to MOVCPM).  I've already installed that
one.  My problem is this:

ONLY when running the CP/M editor 'ed', files larger than one extent (128
records, in my system) end up garbled.  What happens is a sector from the
NEXT extent ends up replacing the corresponding sector in the PREVIOUS
extent.  This continues throughout the whole file.  NONE of the other
programs I have, CP/M-supplied or otherwise, do this.  I have one clue;
when I patch the BIOS to jump around the code that checks for a write to
an unallocated block, the problem goes away.  I have checked and rechecked
the code that is being skipped over, and I can't find anything wrong with
it.  The code in question is between the labels 'chkuna:' and 'alloc:'.
I'm using exactly this code in my BIOS.  Has anyone else had a problem
similar to this one?

I was involved in the shipment of a CP/M system to France last
fall for a three month museum exhibit. The system was a custom
design which had been assembled with parts from about a dozen
manufacturers.

The 8 inch Shugarts were the part of the system we were
most worried about reconfiguring, but it turned out that while
you do have to change a drive belt and a pulley for the main
motor (which is turning more slowly with a 50 Hz AC supply),
this is relatively straightforward and involved no more than
unscrewing the old one and dropping in the new. Although we
probably could have obtained a 220V motor as well, we just used
a 220 to 110 volt transformer which is relatively common
overseas because of all the U.S. equipment used there.  The
parts did take about two months to get since the American
suppliers of Shugart parts don't seem to have a lot of European
components in stock; they probably would have been relatively
easy to get in Europe but we wanted to have everything ready
before we left.

The other worry we had was the compatibility of our black and
white video equipment with European monitors, but, as we had
been assured, European monitors can easily synchronize on a
video signal with standard NTSC characteristics. Fortunately,
we were not working with color since the standards for
broadcast color signals are much different.

Most of the rest of our equipment had been purchased with a
220/110 power supply which could be converted by flipping a
switch and changing a fuse. American style fuses are a little
harder to get in Europe and a little more expensive because
they are not a standard size; it would be worth taking over a
few spares of the new values. One unit had to have the power
cord rewired (the manufacturer had not provided a switch but
had given instructions); another unit had no conversion option
but drew little power and ran fine on the conversion
transformer for the floppies. All in all, we were up and
running in about two days.

It turned out that our largest problem was not the voltage
levels in France, but their unreliability! Fading voltages and
sudden power surges are much more common overseas, and we ended
up having to replace a few fuses (again, take some spares) and
chips. Eventually we ended up grounding everything very
thoroughly and getting a conditioned power line, and had no
further problems for the duration of the show.

I might add that, although it's easy to re-strap a power supply for 220/50 or
what have you, if you want to use your disk drives on both sides of the ocean,
you have a problem.  DC powered drives are all but extinct, and swapping
drive pulleys, belts, motors, etc. doesn't appeal to many.  Best of luck!

DEC unloading surplus keyboards?).  Software included is CP/M 2.2,
SBASIC (structured BASIC?), SELECT (word processor), PROFITPLAN
(spread sheet) and UTILYZE (menu system for CP/M commands).  MBASIC
is optional.  It sells for $1795 and my local dealer assures me he

I am sending a brief amount of information about IBM PC Coherent, because
I was deluged with mail because of the notice put into this group by
watarts!spoon.  For more information than is found herein, contact me 
at this mail address or write to:
	Mark  Williams  Company,
	1430 W Wrightwood Ave,
	CHICAGO,  IL 60614
	(312)-472-6659

Coherent is a UNIX look-alike operating system which is compatible with
the V7 programming and shell interfaces.  It current runs on PDP-11, z8002
(Ithaca Intersystems), 68000  (Exormacs)  and the 8086/8088 (in various
configurations).
	The version for the   IBM PC takes a minimum of 128K bytes of main
memory but it is probably more reasonable to run with 256K.  Either of
the Corvus or the TecMar hard     (winchester) discs can be used.
(The system will run on the minifloppies but they are really too small to
hold any serious amount of software as well as being terribly slow).
	CPU performance seems to be just a nudge (say about 1-2%) faster
than a PDP-11/23 but the hard discs tend to be a little slower than RL drives
so the subjective performance is somewhat slower than Coherent on an 11/23.
Compiler code density is about 14-16% better than that produced (also by
the  Mark Williams C compiler) for the PDP-11.  These numbers were arrived
at somewhat subjectively by looking at sizes and run times when running in the `bc' command.

If anyone has more detailed questions, I will be glad to send answers.
However, for marketing type information contact the company as I am
just a technical person.

Re:   results of search for a cheap micro
Article-I.D.: presby.172
Via:  news.usenet; 22 Jun 82 22:42-PDT

A while ago I send out a request for info on a cheap micro that met the
following specs: Z-80, 64K, two serial ports and maybe a parallel port
with a built in 80x24 screen optional.  I also did extensive research
on my own via the hefty advertising in BYTE.  The results: First the
bad news - unless you want to build it yourself (which I don't) or you
don't need much support (I do need some) the cheap micro doesn't exist.
Given the sum of the costs of the parts, and with Osborne as an example
it should.  The good news is: in a few months the cheap micro will be a
reality.

Now for specifics:

Currently, the cheapest machine with a built in monitor is the Osborne.
It is unacceptable however because of the 5" screen and single-density
drives (a joke, really). The much heralded double-sided option is in
limbo for the moment.  A competitor, KAYCOMP, with a 9" inch screen
(but also ss drives) should be out soon.  It's quality is unknown. By
the way, as far as I'm concerned, getting Wordstar for free is no big
deal - it's not worth much more than that.

>From the $1795 for the Osborne, there is a big jump to the next system
with a build in screen - the Televideo 802 (I skip over the Superbrain
because of its horrendous reputation).  This meets all the specs - it
has two double-sided double-density floppies built into a 950 cabinet.
It has 2 serial one parallel port.  It lists for $3500, but can be
bought for as low as $2600 if you're willing to go mail-order.  I can
get it discounted from a local dealer.  It's nearest competitor is the
NS Advantage, which has the same specs except you have to pay extra for
serial and parallel ports!!  There were some reliability problems in
early versions of the Advantage, which have been shaken out I hear.

As far as systems in a box without a monitor or terminal, Televideo has
an 801, but since it's only $200 cheaper than the 802, I don't know why
anyone would buy it (unless they hated Televideo terminals). Colonial
Data has what appears to be a nice system for $2400 (see BYTE) which
has a close competitor in the Epic Episode. Support for these latter
systems and quality is an unknown.

You can also build your own, using the SB80 (basis of the Colonial
Data) or the big board (basis of the Xerox 820 - a machine Xerox is
phasing out).

All the rest - Zenith, Altos, Morrow Designs, Godbout, Cromemco, Vector
Graphics etc. etc. come in higher than the above for configurations
that meet my specs.  Even the Japanese let me down: e.g. Sanyo has a
system for $1995 with one floppy, which becomes $2995 if you add a
second floppy!!  The NEC PC-8001, as described in some past issue of
BYTE, did not sound like a machine I wanted to get involved with ( I
forgot to mention CP/M based as a prime criteria of my el-cheapo!).

But the good news is that Cromemco and Morrow Designs have both
introduced systems that should meet my specs with flying colors.  The
Cromemco is called the C-10, and with one floppy it costs around $1500
including a monitor.  The only note of discord is there is no mention
of the availability of a second floppy.  A guy at Computerworld said
that he understood a second floppy would not be an option.  If that's
true, Cromemco has blown it!  Morrow Design's Micro-Decision will be
$1100 with one floppy, $1500 with two, but without a terminal.  Both
systems come with a lot of software ala Osborne.

Caveats:  Delivery on these systems are promised for September.  Given
their price and the reputation of their makers, there will probably be
a 90 day wait before you can get your hands on one.  Also, despite
their maker's reputation, there will probably be a six month quality
shakedown period.  So figure by next spring a micro that meets my specs
will be available at a reasonable price.  But by then I'll probably be
looking at some of the new 16-bitters......

Subject:  RCPM hard disk repaired

The 10 megabyte hard disk on my RCPM is now back in service,
thanks to Bob Grier and Dave Mabry, who came over here last
weekend and repaired the broken part.  Luckily we were able
to recover all the files.

For those not familiar with my RCPM - it's a good place
to get files that we talk about here on Info-Cpm if you
cannot access MIT-MC to get them.  It's 313-759-6569
(Detroit, MI. area) and is a "callback" system, which
means you have to ring once, hang up and call back
again.  This is done so that the same line can be
used for voice calls.

Subject: Small Hard Disks
Via:  Mit-Mc; 20 Jun 82 21:42-EDT

If you are looking for a small capacity, but very high speed Winchester hard
disk, you might look into the New World MikroDisc.  Its specifications:

	3.6 Mb formatted
	2 surfaces
	16 heads (8 per surface)
	20 head positions (cylinders)
	optional 3.6 Mb removable cartridge
	8.3 mS latency
	15 mS settle time
	5 mS minimum seek time
	90 mS maximum seek time
	30 mS average seek time

The disk is designed to be used as a cache in a virtual memory system (kinda
like a drum).  An S-100 controller exists, and a "universal" controller is
in the checkout stage.  The universal controller may be adapted to almost
any machine by developing a simple bus adapter.  An S-100 adapter for the
universal controller also exists, so you can have your choice.  The universal
controller attaches directly to the disk drive, and is much better in my
opinion. (Or will be after the checkout stage).  I'm currently using the S-100
controller on a MikroDisc formatted with 32 sectors per track (which gives
2.6 Mb) running CP/M, and I'm quite pleased with it.  Oh yeah, add these to
the specs:

	256, 512 or 1024 bytes a sector with the S-100 and univ. controllers
	up to 40 sectors per track at 256 bytes per sector
	40 sectors of 256 bytes * 16 heads * 20 cylinders gives 3.6 Mb

To: INFO-CPM at Mit-Mc

  Another replacement for the SUBMIT program is now on
MC.  Applicable files are: 

		AR11:CPM;EX ASM 
		AR11:CPM;EX DOC
		AR11:CPM;EX COM

  The principle adventages of EX are that it buffers the
SUBMIT text in memory for speed (it uses the top of the TPA,
then adjusts the BDOS entry pointer to prevent overwriting),
and that it extends the batch concept to character input, elim-
inating the need for XSUB (which only extends batch input to
CP/M function 10 anyway).
  To reassemble, you'll need SID, MAC, REL.UTL (from CPMUG),
and ED.  The COM file is perfectly useable as is, so re-assembly
should not be necessary.

I have been looking at small Winchester disks to add to a CCS system.  The
CDC FINCH was my choice, but today my dealer pointed out the new Seagate
Winchester, 10 megabytes, $975, plus another $545 for a controller (DC-510).
However, he currently doesnt have any info on it other than price.

Anyone have any more info?  What kind of interface is the DC-510?  Is
there a CP/M BIOS (in part) around?  Most important -- is it power safe?
That is, if I loose power while it is spun up will there be potential for
loss of data and/or oxide?  My Priam 1070 works real good, but you sure
better tell it 'DOWN' before power goes away.

Subject: WordStar info/patch needed
Via:  Mit-Mc; 17 Jun 82 17:47-EDT

It irks me to no end that Micropro won't talk to end users.  They refer me
to my dealer who then calls up Micropro, and either he didn't understand
my question, or their response, and thus tells me that what I'm trying to
do isn't possible.

This past weekend, I attempted to install a TRANSTAR 140 printer onto a
system, and instruct WordStar how to talk to it.  The TRANSTAR 140 is a
C.Itoh look-alike with one difference - the guy I was doing this for had
bought a 2k buffer expansion, and this was where I had trouble.  Back in
the USER4 listing, there is a one byte field that you patch with half of
the printer buffersize when you are using the ENQ/ACK protocol.  Obviously,
half of 2k is 1k which is larger than one byte.  

Has anyone else gotten around this?  The main advantage of using the 2k
buffer would be to make things a bit smoother when printing and editing
at the same time.

Via:  Mit-Mc; 16 Jun 82 18:48-EDT

The manual that *should* contain the information on status ports and bits
is the SYSTEM REFERENCE MANUAL (45536-90000).  Unfortunately, I couldn't
find anything that detailed.  The do have an ESC sequence that you can
send to the console, and have returned a sequence of bytes with all sorts
of information.

If you don't have this manual already, you should get it, as it details
all of HP's "Extended System Function" [BDOS] calls.  HP will probably
claim, if you ask them, that the information you need isn't necessary as
you can use these extended calls to have the system do what you want to
do for you.

In any event, if you do find a source for information regarding that sort
of thing I'd appreciate a pointer, as my Dad has an HP125 system at work
and I've been helping him set some things up.

I particularly want an editor that's

or word processor.  Three competitors seem to have received good
reviews (hearsay): VEDIT from CompuView Products, PMATE from Lifeboat
Assoc., and EMACS (perhaps in its MINCE incarnation) from some firm
in the Boston area whose name I forget.  Does anyone have any
firsthand experience with these or other editors?  I'd be grateful

announced such a system.  It is a desk top box with 64K of RAM, a 4MHz Z80
CPU, 2 RS-232 ports and either one or two 200K minifloppy drives.  It
includes CP/M, MBASIC 5.2, BAZIC (N* BASIC for CP/M), Wordstar, Calcstar,
and Spellstar.  Just add a terminal and go.  The price is $1195 with one
drive and $1545 with two drives.  Sounds like a fantastic buy.

The Televideo 801 looks as if it would meet all your specs except
price.  I think it is not such a good buy mostly when compared to
the 802 which adds the equivalent of a Televideo 950 for only a few
hundred dollars more.  P.S. the Televideo models are often

Hi --

        The new version of DASM is now under AR25:CPM on  MIT-MC.
The new files are:

MIT-MC Filename         CP/M Filename   Comments
ZDASM COM               DASM.COM        DASM 1.4 with Zilog Mnemonics
ZDASM MAC               DASM.MAC        Source to 1.4
ZDASMT MAC              DASMTDL.MAC     TDL Module for 1.4


        A few bugs in the previous  version  of  DASM  have  been
fixed  with  this  release.  Particularly, output of the ASM file
has been corrected and the Jump Relative instructions in the  TDL
module now terminate with <CR><LF> appropriately.

        Two key enhancements have also been made in this release.
The DASM command line may now take one of two forms:

                DASM or DASM FILENAME

If the latter is  used,  DASM  will  try  to  load  FILENAME.COM,
FILENAME.CTL, FILENAME.SYM, and FILENAME.DOC.  If it doesn't find
a particular file, it will simply  note  this  and  go  on.   The
Rfilename.ALL command also does the same thing now.

        I would like to give  a  special  thanks  to  Bridger  at
RAND-UNIX for his comments re the bugs in the previous release.

        Enjoy!

                                        Rick

	As BNH and PGA noted, PW is Mince and Scirbbel warmed over. 
However, Source code is not avaailable for any part of PW or PS at all.
What this means ia that in some cases, which are ever decreasing, PW may
prove to be inadaquate. eg:

	1. Apples without an 80 column board can actually be supported,
	however it is not reccommended since most screens of text are 
	trimmed for a 79 column terminal. This means that the menu system is 
	difficult if not impossible to use on an apple with 40 columns, 
	and the configuration process is hard.

	2. Without the source to Crayon, The MotU printer driver, new printer
	drivers are impossible to add. This is not all bad: PW and Crayon will
	indeed support any printer in monospaced modes of operation. Only
	those printers which can proportional space and are not currently 
	supported lose.

	3. The PW editor is roughly 4K bigger than Mince, and all the config
	programs are significantly more verbose... This means that PW MUST HAVE
	a genuine 56K to run in. Many Morrow systems have a CP/M which proclaims
	56K, but indeed has less.

	4. In rebuttal to the InfoWorld article - PW is now being shipped with
	inch and a half binders instead of one-inch ones. We may also include 
	Hardcopy of the lessons, but did not do so for two reasons:

		a. We felt that the lessons are meant to be learned off disk
		and having hardcopy would encourage thair use in an improper
		manner.

		b. The lessons are constantly being revised. Sigh. We would
		have spent as much typesetting the lessons as the rest of the
		wntire manual.

	this policy on the lessons may change in the future...

	5. Obviously, all of PW is in BDS C. All of the other products in the
	Perfect (frob) line are also in C, and we are working on ports to other
	machines and operating systems which support C. Expect to see at least
	a few ??nix versions of PW and the other programs in the PSI stable by
	years' end

 It can be gotten for around $700. I would not hesitate to get  
 another. It is an excellant long haul modem at 1200 baud.

Subject:  ZDASM Version 1.4

Hi --

        I have just uploaded the latest version of DASM (Z80)  to
AR25:CPM  on  MIT-MC.   The files are DASM.MAC (named ZDASM MAC),
DASM.COM (named ZDASM COM), and DASMTDL.MAC (named  ZDASMT  MAC).
DASM.MAC is now over 70K, but the other two files are reasonable.

        DASMTDL.MAC contains a fix for lack of a  <CR><LF>  after
Jump  Relative instructions.  DASM.MAC contains a fix for writing
to the ASM file  and  it  also  contains  two  key  enhancements:
Rfilename.ALL now also reads the COM file (with or without asking
the user), and the command line may include a filename, which has
the  effect of a simple command line followed by Rfilename.ALL as
the first command.  In both of these  enhancements,  if  a  given
file is not found, it is simply noted and the process continues.

        A number of default attributes of DASM are settable  from
an equate table at the beginning of the program.  You may wish to
customize DASM to your own preference by reassembling the source.

        A special thanks goes to Bridger at RAND-UNIX for  point-
ing  out  several  bugs  in version 1.3 of DASM.  I have repaired
those bugs that I could duplicate in this release.   Please  feel
free to comment in general on any additional bugs found.  Enjoy!

                                        Rick

I am using a Racal-Vadic 3212P.  It performs well in a remote
CP/M environment in addition to being an error-free workhorse
at 1200 baud (212).  It has no autodialer, nor does it do
VA3400, but I paid $725, so I'm not complaining.

I have used the Racal-Vadic Va 3451 at both 300 and 1200 baud.
At 1200 it has options for both protocols.  Several RCPM's use it
for 300 and 1200 operation.  It has auto answer but no auto dial.
It has been quite reliable at 1200 baud on autovon lines.  The
speeds are swicthable via the computer and the rs232 connections.

Re:   modems?

I am looking for a modem with 300/1200 baud, I would like to be able
to use the 300 baud for an rbbs, (I would like it to be able to use
the phone when I am not useing the 1200 baud), In short I would like a
1200/300 baud modem, that I could run a version of bye.asm on, and
still use as a 1200 baud modem, (answer,orig).

Does anyone have ideas on what is a good modem for that use? and what
might not be....

Re:   The public-domain screen editor in DDJ Jan'82

Is there a copy on the net of the public-domain source files for the
screen editor written up in Jan. '82 Dr. Dobbs' Journal. I believe I
read that someone has put it into one of the C libraries, but I'm not
sure whether it is the BDS library or not.  I believe the file would
compile under either BDS or the Small-C subset compiler.

Thanks,

I don't quite understand exactly what you want or why, but this might help.
The following is a listing of some sample code run through Macro-80, which
shows how to get it to print the current program counter, as indicated.  If
this isn't what you want, some sample code showing what you're trying to do
might help.

Subject: NOT a DDT bug...
Via:  Mit-Mc; 11 Jun 82 21:18-EDT

Well, I've finally found the REAL cause of the 'bug'... I have a Bitstreamer
board that I use to talk to my modem and 68000 board.  I had installed the
interrupt-enabling jumpers on the board, as directed by the manual, but was
not actually using the interrupts.  Well, when I thought I had solved the
problem by swapping Z-80 chips, I had not plugged in the Bitstreamer board
while I tested the system, since the board kind of hides the CPU board, and
if I was going to have to remove the CPU board again, I didn't want to have
to remove the Bitstreamer too.  Well, I've learned my lesson (again!) about
never testing a change in hardware without setting up identical conditions...
anyway, when I ripped out all of the interrupt jumpers from the Bitstreamer,
the problem went away for good.  Has anyone experienced a similar problem with
the Bitstreamer?  I WOULD like interrupts from this board - but NOT if it is
going to screw up DDT......

    Is there any way to hang more than one terminal off of it?
    Is the file handler provided by DEC adequate for a database
       of about 2000 records, record size about 1000 bytes?
