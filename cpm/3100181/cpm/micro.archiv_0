c
A while ago it was asked what purpose there is in owning a personal
computer.  (what are those fool things good for, anyway? or something like
that.)  I didn't see my particular reason in the responses, so I might
as well add it.

I am one of those people (there are many) who got into programming by
accident; I never intended to do it as a career but got completely swept
away by it.  As a result, I am one of those fortunate folks for whom my
job is not just a means to making money, but a means for doing what I
like as well.  Which is why I never had a question of what a personal
computer is good for - it is simply an end in itself.  It allows me
to follow up on some of those thoughts like: "boy I'd like to try to
write a type x program, but it ought to do THIS neat thing too...".

As for why the average person wants one, I see no reason why everyone can't
enjoy them in the same way that I do.  I don't feel the need to justify
mine economically (justify your snowmobile or boat or pool table or...).

	I thought only SUN made them.

	DO any of these 68000 based things (with unix) support floating point?


Cadlink claims to be working on an 8086/8087 board for their SUN board
system. Delivery date is "soon". This is intended to be a stopgap measure
until Motorola starts deliveries of their floating point chip (4Q83 ??).
Floating point for most of these systems is now done in software.

I'm sorry, but I agree with Pournelle.  He made a slight error in
saying that there are extra keys between the \space bar/ and the shift
key.  In any case, however, the shift keys and the Return key ARE
farther away than on the standard keyboard, and considering the
frequency with which these keys are used, that is quite sufficient to
ruin the whole keyboard, at least for touch typists who learned to
type on a normal keyboard.  Why IBM did this I don't know, since the
keyboards on their typewriters are excellent.  As for the PC
keyboard's good "feel," that can hardly compensate for the bad feeling
I get from typing the wrong characters because the keys are misplaced.

One reason for the poor graphics may be that computer professionals are
excellent computer people but, perhaps related to that reason, are not
particularly excellet writers.  I know some writers also, who want
nothing to do with computers, thus cannot write with knowledge about
them in a readable style.

	I agree, and concede the point. It doesn't HAVE to be this way.

	The thing that burns me is those of us in the academic computer
world who look upon computers as being `our' property. It's a pretty
snobbish attitude to try to exclude the rest of the world from computers
and computing devices just because they are complicated and the `average
user can't be expected to understand them.' The average user WON'T under-
stand, as long as the infamous jargon and other attempts by computerists
to keep the field to themselves exist.

	No, no, no. . .you misunderstand my point. There's no conspiracy
to keep computers away from the masses. It's just that a lot of computer
scientists have secret feelings (or job insecurities) which make them
feel as though they had to keep the technology to themselves, and to let
the public have only a watered-down, simplified version of their knowledge.
Thus, home computers become tax-computing, game-playing toys.

	It's good that you have such an attitude towards your profession.
Unfortunately I think that much of the reason for the lousy documentation
in personal computer software (and also the somewhat shallow software
available) is due to hidden fears on the part of some CS people.

   really, what makes you think this?  and are you really talking about
"computer scientists" (ie, academics & researchers), or more generally
"computer professionals" (programmers and engineers in the industry)?
can you point out an example of technology withheld from the public by
computer scientists or professionals for such venal reasons?
   i don't own a personal computer myself, because i have basically free
access to far more computer than i could hope to buy for my own.  i have
done a few personal applications, but nothing to brag about.  now, if i,
presumably clued in to the technology, can't dramatically apply it to my
own personal life, why should i assume that if novices can't either, it's
because info i have is being withheld from them?  i can agree with you that
most PCs are schlock, but not for the reasons you give.

   Here it is: I've got the June, 1982 issue of BYTE in front of
me; page 288.

	``. . .Only IBM has RUINED the keyboard! What ought to be its
	strongest point, the thing IBM always excelled at, is its worst
	mistake.
	   What IBM did was to put extra keys between the space bar and
	the Shift key. Why, I don't know. The result is that when you 
	think you've typed, say, a capital T, you get instead /t, which 
	isn't useful at all.
	   There is also no line-feed key; instead IBM seems to have
	manipulated the Carriage Return key to give both carriage return
	and line feed when struck. . .I suppose there's a way to filter
	that madness; but there's no help for the Shift key being
	mislocated, nor for the egregious amount of space between the home
	keys and the Return key.
	   I may one day buy an IBM--but not until I get over the shock
	of that ruined keyboard. I've never been so disappointed in my
	life.''

   There was no mention of the feel of the IBM PC keyboard anywhere in
the column. I'm not sure what he means by "extra characters between the
space bar and the Shift key;" the shift keys and the space bar are not
adjacent on any keyboard I've ever seen. I think what he really means
is the \ key, between the Z and the left shift key. Thus the "/t" he
mentions should really be "\t", which is what you'd get from not reaching
far enough for the left shift.

   My own personal comment, if I may: Right now I'm typing on an IBM 3101
terminal, which has the "<" key placed between the Z and the left shift,
and the return key is exactly the same distance from the ";" key (and thus
the rest of the home row for touch-typists) as on the IBM PC keyboard.
I find the 3101 a joy to use; the keyboard has an excellent feel and none
of the above complaints ever get in MY way. This opinion is shared by
many of the other users here at CSO--I'll take this over a VT100 any day.
I've only had a few minutes at an IBM PC, but from what I experienced, I'd
be quite happy with that, too. The keyboard remains the strong point of
IBM's design, despite what Jerry Pournelle says.

	The problem is in the software. Hardly any of the software
manufacturers for microcomputers make any attempt whatsoever to target
their software at the "average user." Most of the time, the documentation
is nonexistent, very poor, or aimed at someone who is knowledgeable in
the field of microcomputers. The programs that are available are mostly
games, granted, but there is a wide, untapped market. Home lighting
control and security, for example--with a phone interface, a speech
synthesizer, and a touch-tone decoder, the average person could easily
inquire about and control the status of his house from far away. This
sort of thing is simple--if only a company would take the time to make
the software and hardware as easy to install as, say, a washing machine.

	The problem is that everyone in the computer field thinks of
microcomputers in terms of computers. What can they do? Well, they can
crunch numbers, store vast amounts of data, communicate with a large
network, and can be excellent text processors. Fine. These are the
*ACADEMIC* uses of computers (micros being a subset). The *PERSONAL*
applications of computers are different; the audience is much different.
They don't care what the computer can do, what kind of microprocessor it
has, what kinds of networks it can connect to, or even how many floating-point
multiplies it can perform in a second. They are interested only in a machine
to make life easier and more entertaining for themselves. They want 
to be able to organize business records, keep notes, type out letters,
and so on. And those companies which first come out with programs that
the personal computer user really wants, well DOCUMENTED and EASY TO
USE and MEETING THE NEEDS of the home computer users, will be making a buck.

	There is an application out there for computers. The long worn
statement that computers can make anything easier is true. It's just
that the home applications have gone unnoticed for so long. They are
NOT the same as our ideas of computer applications, and the two sets
of needs will never meet. God help us if they ever do. But the want is
there nevertheless.

The people who read this mail via BBOARD is one problem that may be
solved by the BBOARD optional library for BABYL - but that is only
good where BABYL is available: TENEX, TOPS-20, and ITS.  The Unix
and other users are left out.

Digest tend to be large, but limited by some mailer restrictions on
most systems to about 15K.  Even still, that is a long time to hog on
a USENET connection chain, whereas alot of small messages tend to get
through quickly and also let other small msgs through as well - a more
equitable distribution.

So where are we?  Probably back to the state where the old INFO-MICRO
left us - digests and direct - and you know what happened to the
digest list...

Possible solution (if someone is *really* able to commit to daily
digest moderation): leave all the multi-drop users (BBOARDS and
USENET, etc.) on direct mail, and the rest who can use BABYL or some
equivalent undigestifying mechanism on the digest list.  How many does
that accomodate?

Thus, a survey: send me mail if you prefer a digest format and we'll
count them up and come to some arbitrary conclusion to see if it is
worth the effort.  Let's hold off further discussion until the numbers
are in.

Thanks,
Frank

It's really a two-faced problem.  One really doesn't want to choke the
Net with messges.  On the otherhand, there are definite reliability
problems with turning the list into a Digest.  Having a list in
digest form translates into continuing human intervention, not for weeks,
but for months, or even years.  Further, it is kind of annoying when
the mail to the list doesn't get digested at least every other day.  
When the digest goes out once a week or less, it kind of defeats the idea
of electronic mail.

Another problem with "digestion" is censorship.  All too often, messages
from people get "lost", either by accident or on purpose.  While I'm
not fond of receiving "blank" mail or 10 copies of a letter, I would
like to see all the stuff sent to a list, so that I can decided what I
want to read.

What I am trying to get at is that if Info-MICRO does go "digest", we
really need a moderator that is willing to play postman on a daily
basis.

An alternative idea is to have direct mailing to people who want it, and
a weekly digest for people who don't care one way or the other.

Keith, if you use the Emacs Babyl system to read bboards then digest format
is not a problem.

Digest format helps make net traffic more efficient (one large message as
opposed to many small ones), is usually less redundant, and topics for
discussion can be better defined.  I think we could get this out of a
digestified INFO-MICRO and not lose as long as the "intended" topics of
discussion for the bboard remain open-ended.  INFO-MICRO has acted very
successfully as a catch-all for random info tidbits about micros.  That is
something I would not like to see change.

If anyone would like to argue this point please reply to me, I guess we
should keep from cluttering up INFO-MICRO.  The consensus will be made
known if some conclusion is reached.

In response to NEVES@MIT-MC:

I disagree with a few points of your note.  While I am skeptical of Atari
dropping its 400 price by 50%, I would be delighted if they did.  It would
make it cheap enough for me to consider buying a second machine.  I already
have a 800 with all the goodies.

I consider the lack of a built-in language a PLUS!  Suppose I wanted to use
Microsoft Basic rather than Atari's (actually I prefer Atari's Basic), then
why should I pay for Atari's Basic?  What if I only want to use PILOT or
FORTH or C or PASCAL (no, I'm not that masochistic) or even just the assembly
language?

"This lack of emphasis {on computational capabilities} will result in lack
of software, lack of cheap floppies, and horrible keyboards."  I know Atari
will be pushing software for games rather than, say, text editors for the
the foreseeable future, but if you wanted to get rich and famous, would you
want to write a text editor for the Apple machines or for the Atari when there
are 20 times as many Ataris out there?  Wouldn't it be more profitable for
a hardware manufacturer to produce a floppy (or a hard disk) for Atari even
though only 20% of the Ataris have disk drives rather than for Apple?

(I grant it will be harder to separate the junk (poorly written/designed)
programs for the Atari from the good ones because there will be more programs.)

I believe that TI's price drop is out of desparation - the TI99 has been a
flop.  Last December's price drop for the Ataris and any future price drops
will probably come as a result of savings because of the quantity sold.

As for the keyboard:  An 800 keyboard can be attached to the 400.  I wouldn't
be too surprised if someone other than Atari starts supplying these.  (Atari
does NOT sell them but you can find some surplus ones.)
(For those who do not know, the 400 and 800 are computationally identical.
The differences include the keyboard, only one cartridge slot on the 400 (but
no one uses the second one on the 800), and the memory card and OS are harder
to get at on the 400.  There are some hardware products by other vendors that
require the memory slots that only the 800 has.  But the price difference is
about $600-$700.)

I think proper complaints about the Atari might include the fact that there is
no easy way to get at the bus, serial i/o is slower than parallel, and the
company's policy of charging so much for software (but so does everyone else).
I believe Atari sees their hardware products (VCS, 400, 800) as Gillette(?)
saw their razors.  You can afford to give them away if you make all your money
on what goes into them!

Run Babyl and use M-X Undigestify Babyl Message, which separates a
digest into individual messages.  Then you can read/delete them after

There is news of at least a couple of computer manufacturers slashing
their prices.  There was a story in several financial papers a few days
ago about how TI is going to reduce the price of the 44/a by $100 (to
$199 retail) starting in Sept.  In some info-atari mail it was rumored
that the Atari 400 will be reduced to $150 in a couple of weeks.

I have a gripe about all these soon-to-be-under-$200 machines.  I am
worried that more emphasis will be played on the video game playing
capabilities rather than computational capabilities.  This lack of
emphasis will result in lack of software, lack of cheap floppies, and
horrible keyboards.  

Look at the Atari 400 for example.  Fantastic graphics.
However, it clearly is oriented to games.  If one wanted to write
programs one has to buy a BASIC cartridge, cassette recorder, and has to
suffer with the flat keyboard that wasn't really meant for typing.

What should the real home computer have?  This is my list.  You may
disagree.

1.  Regular keyboard layout with keys that go up and down.  The VIC is
the only one that has this (I don't know anything about the Trash-80
color computer).

2.  Color (all the cheap computers have this)

3.  Built in language (i.e. BASIC).  Atari doesn't have this but it can
be purchased.

4.  Floppies.  I consider cassette tape to be inadequate for program
storage.  It is too slow and error prone.  The problem is that floppy
storage is still too expensive for the micros.  You're talking 500-600
bucks for that first floppy.

5.  Communication capabilities (ie. RS232 interface for a coupler).  I think
the Trash-80 system has it built in,  the VIC has a cheap addition one
can buy, TI 44/a has expensive addition as does the Atari 400.  There is
a cheap direct connect modem for $100 (Signalman -- it is battery
powered).

6.  Total system cost should be in the range of a stereo, i.e. under $600.

I would  !! NOT !! want INFO-MICRO done in a 'digest' format
because since it is so large, I can just not read the messages
that I am not interested in because of what the header says!

By the way, our system is done such that we get one copy of each of
the mailing lists (info-micro, info-cpm, info-apple, info-atari)
onto a different directory and then everybody that is interested in 
reading them uses the BBOARD program to read what ever mailing lists 
they want to.  The BBOARD program displays the header, who it is from,
and allows you to either read it or skip onto the ext msg.

Hello,
	I am getting ready to buy two ZX81 (w 16k Ram each) and I would like
to network them together.  I am planning on writting truely two player
'war games' with each player using one ZX81.  I have chosen the ZX81 for the
simple reason that at $80 for a kit and $50 for 16k Ram I can buy the two 
whole systems for only $260.  I was wondering if there were any other ZX81
owners out there in net land and if anyone had allready done the hardware to
hook two ZX81 up?

Wonderful! Someone else to share our problems! We also have a Cadlinc SUN
workstation, and we have noticed the same trouble as you have when using the
thing as a "terminal" -- it is very slow once it starts scrolling and the
character set does look very strange. The scroll problem really can't be
helped, as such. It stems from the fact that scrolling the screen requires you
to move about 100Kb of memory, or about 50,000 iterations of a loop to move the
screen memory.
  We've come up with several possible solutions to this problem, but they are
kind of on hold right now. One involves just erasing the screen everytime it
reaches the bottom margin, or perhaps moving the bottom half to the top half
and then erasing the bottom half, so that you have at least 1/2 of your
screen sitting around.
   Another alternative would be to use the smaller character set (the z1 set,or
a home-made version thereof) and then have a smaller window on the screen,
which would require moving less memory. This would eliminate the slow scroll,
but it out also kill your eyes in short order.
   I would be interested in hearing what software & documentation they sent
you. We might be able to arrange sharing some utilities and whatnot. Send
mail to "pur-ee!uiucdcs!grunwald" if you're interested.

Greetings!  I just received some information about a UNIX/System III
Multi-user configuration built around a machine called the Pixel 100/AP.     
This is what the system looks like:

	100/AP (sic) Supermicrocomputer (68K/8 Mhz)
	1 mByte 150ns dynamic RAM
	128k I/O processor memory
	40 mByte Winchester disk w/controller
	2 x 630k Diskette drives
	8 x Pixel terminals (!)
	8 x RS232 ports
	2 x parallel ports
	UNIX System III
	Choice of programming language (includes 'C', UCSD Pascal...)

(And the bottom line ...)	Price = $19,900.00

Well!  Has anyone heard of these folks?  Better still, does anyone
have any experience with this stuff?  To get 8 users on a UNIX
system for ~ $20K seems hard to believe.  Comments please - I'm in a
bit of a hurry!

Thanks in advance...

Anyone have any other nifty downloadable programs?  We don't
have any disks yet.

"Mattel Co., the giant toy maker, has been found guilty of infringing on
a patent controlled by Magnavox Co. by marketing an electronic game. 
U.S. District Court Judge George N. Leighton ruled in Chicago that
Mattel's Intellivision game was so similar to a Magnavox game called
Odyssey that the Odyssey patent was infringed.  James T. Williams,
lawyer for Magnavox, said that Magnavox obtained the license to produce
Odyssey from Sanders Associates of Nashua, N.H., owners of the patent.
 ....  Leighton issued a verbal opinion Thursday after an eight-day
hearing.  He said he would issue a written ruling later.

In regard to the conduct of Intertec, here is my experience.  I purchased
a Superbrain II recently to develop software for a tester on our production
floor which is controlled by a Superbrain.  To my surprise, the two 
machines are not compatible.  I was not told this by anyone even when I
told them the use of the new machine.  When I called Intertec, I was told
that they were too busy right now and they would call me back.  After four
hours they had not called.  I called back and was connected to a very 
obnoxious CS rep who was no help at all.  I spent two days and 8 phone
calls before I found someone at Intertec who was helpful.  I have used
the machine for approximately 4 months with no problems, but I would not
buy another because of the attitude of Intertec.

JCP claims that CP/M-86 is `one of 3 OSes available, the best is MS-DOS
however.'. Presumably he is referring to the 3 OSes as IBM PC DOS,
MS-DOS and UCSD. There is now a fourth alternative (at least).
You can buy a full UNIX reimplementation called Coherent for $500
from Mark Williams, Chicago, 312-472-6659.  That includes a C compiler,
a full sort utility, and an incredible range of other utilities
as well as editors, mail, nroff text formatter, assembler, debugger,
etc, etc. A real bargain on UNIX systems! Compare the cost to
MSDOS or UCSD or CPM with sort, compilers, etc, and you may agree.

	I'm looking for a version of C for a Z80-CP/M system.  I've used
Whitesmith's C and was not too impressed.  Compile times are long, the
executable files produced were very large and very slow.  And to make life
interesting, standard functions are renamed and redefined.  The price tag
(~600-700 dollars) scares me away also.
	I've heard some good things about BD Software C and am wondering
if anybody out there has had any experience with it and/or can tell me

68000 systems that use a second processor to handle page faults while the
first processor is in a very long memory wait can (or should) be able to
handle arbitrary page faults (i.e. there should be no reason why only
data or only program references would work).  The catch is that with the
dual processor scheme, there is nothing else you can do during a page
fault (except field interrupts -- provided the hardware allows the second
processor to handle interrupts when the first processor is stalled).
In particular, the first processor cannot run code for another process
since the paging stunt depends on that processor hanging in a memory cycle.

Depending on how independent the second processor is, you may be able to
get other useful work out of it when it isn't handling a page fault (I believe
that Apollo uses a second processor to handle the network and some graphics),
but in order to do this effectively it would need some memory of its own
(or else some very fast system memory).  The problem is that a 68000 is
basically a memory-limited machine (most internal clock cycles are used
for memory cycles), and are often faster than system memory (i.e. wait states
are required), so there isn't any extra bandwidth for a second processor
to run without drastically interfering with the first.

The limitation on page fault handling imposed by the second processor should
not be too big a problem on a single user system, although ambititous
UNIX users can easily generate several active processes (i.e. edit in
foreground with a compilation in the background), but would obviously have
a chilling effect on time sharing.

  The only system I've used that's equal to or better than Unix
is good, old Multics.  However, Honeywell seems to want to price
and un-support Multics out of existence - the USGS is getting rid
of three systems in the next three years because of various
Honeywell policies.

  We have a lot of software written in PL/1 for Multics (PL/1 is
to Multics as C is to Unix).  Hence, some desperate requests for
PL/1 compilers on Unix.

  Multics is an excellent program development environment (more
so than V7 Unix), and I would like to see this nifty environment
live on and expand.

  (Flame on):  Multics is a damn sight better documented
internally and externally than Unix - I've dealt with source code
on both systems.  Multics is also a lot more consistent than Unix
(Flame off).

  So - does anyone know of any plans to move Multics to any of
the latest micros?  Multics seems a natural for the Motorola
68010, NS 16032, or Intel iAPX 432.

Hello,

  Having recently purchased the F-10 printer (at a very reasonable cost), I
can vouch for it's high quality.  I have installed it under WS 3.0, and it 
works like a champ.  This is nice, seeing as how it's my thesis printer.

  The only gripe I have is that, while TEC does an outstanding job on
hardware, their documentation reads like a 1930 camera instruction book.
Even with an updated manual containing the various control codes, it is
very nearly impossible to decipher the meanings of the various sequences.
Handshaking (parallel version) is rough, and I still haven't figured how
to drive the blasted thing from the CP/M LST: device.  The BUSY line isn't
asserted except for during the time the printer is accepting the character
from the lines....which for some reason allows it to drop characters, maybe
during the rather slow carriage return.

  Gripes aside, for the cash outlay, you can't beat the product, especially
since WS has an INSTALL option that sets it up so you don't have to fool
with it.

Daniel J Blumenfeld's recent message to this list suggested an
interesting idea.

Given the profusion of S-100 boards on the market, Info-Micro could do
a very important service by organizing some sort of database about
each board, including questions similar to those in Dan's message.
Information might be kept on who had which boards, for those who did
not mind the information being publicly available, so that those who
had or were considering buying that particular board could correspond.
The database could be similar in form to the tree-structured
documentation used on the ITS systems (those who have used the
Info-Terms node of this tree will know what I'm talking about as it
applies to hardware recommendations---similar systems also run under
Twenex).

I remember a letter some months ago by someone who went through all
the ads for memory boards he could find, listing all sorts of useful
information.  Such an effort, and others like it, deserve to be
included somewhere where everyone can get at the informtion, as do
less inclusive information about particular boards that people have.

For this effort, we need a separate submission list, a set of
"standard" questions about any given board (plus any other information
that pertains only to a class of products such as memory, particular
types of disk interface boards, A/D/A boards, etc), a way to structure
the information (almost certainly we do not want to keep the letters
themselves, but only the salient points, keeping the letters elsewhere
maybe as a backup), and, most importantly, someone to do all of this.

Since I suggested this, the logical idea would be for me to do it.
Unfortunately, I will not have the time, and probably not the disk
space.  Is anyone else interested in a time-consuming job that would
be greatly appreciated by all those who are buying or will buy S-100
systems?  If so, I'd be more than happy to contribute some time at the
beginning to try to figure out what needs to be asked and how the
information might be structured.

If there are only a few people on Info-Micro who want to be bothered
with all this foolishness (after all, not all micros are S-100 by a
long shot!), I can certainly set up a \temporary/ discussion list
using an ITS as a home site, assuming that the list does not grow to
encompass a large percentage of Info-Micro (for that, we'd need a
person with some system responsibility here to justify the amount of
mail the list would entail, and wouldn't need the list anyway because
we could use Info-Micro directly).  (Anyone else on this list with some
\real/ responsibility on an ITS might prefer to do it themselves...)

Any takers?  Any comments?

I received a promotional copy of the EMMS newsletter (sorry, but I threw
out the envelope with the address on it by accident...).  It is a
newsletter devoted to electronic mail systems.  I enclose this article
on the F-10 printer, because I believe it is of interest to the community.
I can NOT vouch for any of it (except that it was sent to me via US
Snail).  Having seen the ads in question, I tend to buy the article as T.
I quote the article in it's verbose entirety (the author must be a frust-
rated novelist...).  Pages 9-10:

PRICE WAR IN DAISYWHEEL PRINTERS?

The May issue of BYTE magazine ran one of the most unique ads we've ever
seen.  It was from a company called Write Writer (Santa Monica, CA) and
was more of a defense than an ad.  Write Writer told the story of how it
was being maligned by the supposedly exclusive distributers of a
daisywheel printer, the Printmaster F-10, for making false claims about
pricing.  But let's begin at the beginning.

In the April BYTE, Write Writer ran an ad promoting the 40 cps F-10 at
the astonishingl low price of $1295., which is even less than what 20
cps daisywheels sell for.  The F-10 is manufactured by Tokyo Electronics
Inc. (TEC) of Japan and distributed in the U.S. by C. Itoh.  In turn, C.
Itoh sells the printer OEM to Leading Edge Products (Canton, MA), which
also sells OEM to retail stores with a suggested list price of about
$1,895.

Leading Edge's retail computer store customers have offered the F-10 for
as low as $1,495, but $1,295 is probably what it sells for to the
retailers.  So how could Write Writer sell it for $1,295?  Curious?  We
sure were and have cleared away enough of the smoke to find that there's
enough fire to ignite a burning price war in daisywheel printers.

TEC:  The story begins with TEC, a master in the art of daisywheel
printing.  TEC manufactures Radio Shack's daisywheel printer and the
Starwriter line carried by C. Itoh in the U.S.  Its new product is the
F-10, which weighing just 30 pounds, is plug-compatible with Qume,
Diablo, and NEC printers and stands a mere 6" high.

A low price is no great feat if the manufacturer cuts quality corners to
produce a device that can't stand up to the same load as the higher
priced daisywheels.  But it turns out that the Printmaster is quite a
different animal.

A source from the word processing industry has told EMMS that his firm
has tested the F-10 exhaustively by literally running it into the ground
and said that it matched Qume, Diablo and NEC in reliability, quality
and durability.  In our source's opinion, it is a great printer.

Write Writer vs. Leading Edge vs. C. Itoh:  Now, the reliabilty of the
printer doesn't have anything to do with Write Writer's price of $1,295
versus Leading Edge's suggested retail price of $1,895.  Is Write Writer
selling hot printers?  That is, of course, one explanation.  But it
doesn't seem to be the right one.

It turns out that the TEC will sell in large volumes, according to our
source, for $695 per unit. Write Writer apparently got a hold of units
sold in Japan for this price and is going direct to end users at $1,295,
a move that sent Leading Edge right over its own. 

Leading Edge immediately called C. Itoh, which made an unscheduled call
on Write Writer and began telling customers that the ad was a fake,
etc., and that Write Writer couldn't really be selling the F-10 for that
price.

This led to Write Writer's unique ad in the May issue, telling of C.
Itoh's visit and of Leading Edge's contest of Write Writer's claim.  At
base, then, the ad was really a counter to assure customers that Write
Writer is selling its units for $1,295.

The Coming Price War?  This, of course, isn't the end of the story.  Its
only just begun.  Major word processing companies are intensely
interested in a daisywheel printer that could be procured for $695 OEM,
especially since our sources have tested the device and found it
reliable. 

If this story holds true -- there are numerous twists and turns in this
funny business, especially when trying to unravel relationships like TEC
- C. Itoh - Leading Edge, etc. -- then there is a price war coming in
daisywheel printers that will be unlike any that the industry has ever
seen.

Keytronics (the company that manfactures the IBM PC keyboard) sells a number
of OEM versions of the keyboard.  The standard version sends out RS-422 Serial
ASCII data at 300 baud.  The PC version on the other hand, is described by
Keytronics as:  "30K baud Syncronous Serial Output with Up/Down codes and
Special Handshaking".  While I'm familiar with Syncronous serial links, and
I'm pretty sure that I understand what they mean by "Up/Down" codes, I'd like
to hear from some PC owners (who are familiar with the PC hardware docs)
about the keyboard interface.  Specifically, who generates the 30K baud
clock, the PC? or the Keyboard?  Is there some sort of line from the keyboard
to the PC to indicate RESET (I know that you have to press a few keys to
reset the PC).  Is the serial link RS-422, as on the ASCII OEM version?
Is there any special sort of handshaking, as Keytronics mentions, or are
they simply talking about the fact that they keyboard sends Up/Down codes
rather than ASCII.  Any info would be appreciated.

My understanding of P40 is that it is a longer persistant P4.  The
reason it is used is to reduce frame refresh frequency from 60 (the
minimum required by P4) to as low as 30 Hz.  The Xerox Star uses P40
at 38.75 Hz interlaced.  The Alto also uses P40.  It leaves a smear
when the screen changes dynamically.  The Alto is refreshed at 30
Hz. interlaced (namely 30 Hz. frames, 60 Hz. fields).

For text processing applications, I would think that 30Hz interlaced
of P40 is the absolute minimum.  At this speed, having white
characters on a black background is a must or you will get flicker.
I have played with the Alto a lot and it hasn't disturbed me much.
However for animated graphics, and even static graphics with a lot
of redisplay or when thin lines that are on the same field happen to
be close together (such as in crosshatches), 30 Hz. is too slow.

Some people claim that if refresh rates are increased slightly (e.g.
to 33 Hz. or the Star rate), then the improvement (other than
getting out of beat with fluorescent lighting) is drastic and thus
cost effective.  Could somebody out there elaborate on this?

Does anyone have any opinions on the relative merits of the different
voice synthesizers now on the market?  I am particularly interested
in the ones that are RS-232 interfaced, and have built in text-to-
phoneme conversion capability. (Of course I also want to directly
output phoneme codes somehow).

The three units that I'm aware of are the Type 'n Talk by Votrax,
the Echo-GP by Street Electronics, and the Intex-talker from
Intex Micro Systems.  Are there any others that I've missed?

I am particularly interested in the relative quality of the
text-to-speech algorithms used.  Are any of them more sophisticated
than any other? Or do they all sound as bad as the Votrax unit?

Please respond directly to me, and I will post a summary of anything
interesting I find out to the list.

	Regarding the previous article on differences between the 68000
and the 68010:  You should already know that the 68000 does not handle
instruction restart.  The only way you can implement a true Virtual
Memory architecture using the 68000 is to use two processors.  One
does the real work, and the other handles faults (if you have a page
fault, the second processor reads in the page for you, being very
careful not to fault itself, of course).  The second processor does
not have to be a 68000, but it's cleaner if it is (Apollo has taken
this approach, as have a few others).  The disadvantage here, of
course, is that the first processor can do nothing while the second
one is handling the exception.  You can optimize this a little,
but the code is very nasty (speaking from experience here).

	The 68010, then, needs no fancy hackery.  Like a PDP-11,
it can restart instructions.  Equipped with an MMU, you could handle
various forms of VM.  The SUN machine has an architecture which
lends itself nicely to dropping in a 68010 (pin-for-pin compatible
with the 68000, remember), and a little exception handling code,
and ending up with a much more powerful system.

	Seems like this has been explained before, somewhere.  I
can only hope the readers of this list are now enlightened.

While helping a friend select boards for his S-100 system, we realized the
difficulty in choosing one board over another.  Besides the problem of
catalog descriptions making even the worst board look great, the "trusted"
names in S-100 stuff (Godbout, Morrow, etc.) have to manufacture boards 
which are similar, but have "minor" differences (e.g. Morrow sells four
stock versions of Disk Jockeys:  Memory Mapped at E000, Memory Mapped at
F800, I/O Mapped, and DMA).

For starters, I'd like to conduct an S-100 Floppy Disk Controller survey.
If you own or use an S-100 system with a disk controller, I'd like to
know your experiences with it.  Here's the info that I'd like to collect:

1.  The Make, Model Number, and year of manufacture of the Disk Controller.
2.  Number of years that you've used the controller.
3.  Features that the board has that you like (or feel worth mentioning).
4.  Features that the board lacks which you wish it had.
5.  Reliability info:  Does the board run "forever", does it have a habit of
    dying, etc.
6.  Service record:  Number of hardware failures, and number of repairs.
7.  Software support:  CP/M included?  Ease of modifying BIOS.
8.  Documentation:  Good board documentation?  Good configuration/BIOS
    documentation?
9.  If you've had to deal with the manufacturer, are they helpful?
10. Any other info which you consider important.

If you wish to respond to this survey, please send your replies to
DAN@MIT-ML.  Please be terse (i.e. I don't need detailed hardware
descriptions of your board).  In a week or so, I'll crunch all the replies
and make the survey results available.  Individual replies will be
kept confidential (as usual).  I am especially interested in hearing
from people using the newer DMA controllers.  Please do NOT send info
about S-100 Hard Disk Controllers (yet).  I know that there are alot
of people out there who use S-100 Floppy Disk Controllers, so any info
would be greatly appreciated.

I've been looking for the CRT phosphor specs for type P40 phosphor, without
much luck. Supposedly, P40 is similar to P4 but with a slightly different
hue and different decay characteristics.  The info is probably in the
EIA CRT specs doc., but unfortunately, I don't have one (the doc costs
over $40).  I'd also like to know what phosphor is used on the Xerox Alto.
When I used one, I noticed that the screen seemed "whiter" than P4.

I just spoke to Brian Grams of D-G Electronics, the company offering
the Super 89 board, the 4mhz CPU board replacement for the Heathkit H89.

Its price is $829 for a board with 64K.  Additional sets of
64K, up to 256K, are $125 each.  There are sockets to allow
you to add your own, if you like.  In addition to all the other
goodies mentioned in previous messages, it also has a socket for
the 4mhz 9511A arithmetic processor.

The H19[A] requires power supply modifications to support all
the additional hardware which comes with an H89, so just getting
the Super 89 board won't work.  The bad news is that Heath's H89 upgrade
kit for either the H19 or H19A can't be obtained without the Heath CPU
board (the one that won't be used).

The good news is that D-G will be offering their own H19[A] upgrade kit
consisting of their 64K board and the power supply mods for $950-$1000.
It should be available in late September.  One buys Heath's disk controller,
disk, and possibly their 3-port serial interface, and you've got it made.
The Super 89 runs a standard Heath CP/M, and MP/M will be forthcoming
(they wouldn't say when).

I should re-iterate that my experience was on the Intertec INTERTUBE II 
terminal, not the Superbrain. The Company may have gotten its head together,
quality control wise. I personally would be very wary of them from past experience,
but they might have a fairly reliable computer in the Superbrain.

   I find it hard to believe that you have had so many problems
with Intertec.  The company I work for has purchased 6
Superbrains so far.  I must say that we have been very happy
with them so far.

  First of all, not one of them was "dead on
arrival".  The store we purchased them from would take them out
of the box and try them out before selling them.  However, I
dont remember seeing a Superbrain fail that test.  

  The problems we have had with the machines have all been
related to the power supply or the floppy disc drives.  In the 2
years we've had them, most of them have broken down at one point
or another (I think a couple are still going strong).  When they
do break, we've generally shipped them down to Intertec.  In all
cases, Intertec repaired the units and shipped them back in 2
weeks.  I also think the repair costs were reasonable.

  By the way, the cost of schematics for SB's is $50.  I also
have a set for Intertubes/Emulators that cost me a whole $25.
Although they did not come with any explanations, I found the SB
schematics to be complete and accurate: I have repaired a couple
of them myself).

  I have also had the occasion to speak with some of the
Intertec customer service/technical staff.  Most of them have
been very helpfull and very willing to spend their time trying
to figure out some of my problems, hardware and sofware, with
the machines.

  All in all, Superbrains are great machines for the price.  We
have found them to be pretty reliable and easy to repair.  They
are now selling for $2000 and a 10M hard disc goes for $2700. 
Who else is selling similar machines for that price?

Hi,

  At the risk of starting a deluge of 'preference' type messages, here is
some information relative to the recent virtual memory message.

  Zilog has developed the Z8003 Virtual Memory Processing Unit (an extended
Z8001) which, when used in conjunction with the Z8015 Paged Memory Management
Unit, should make virtual memory multitasking systems easier to implement.
The chip set runs at a 10 MHz clock rate and addresses up to 48Mbytes of
distinct memory space.

  Anyone interested in this stuff drop me a line.  I'm currently working on
a multitasking OS for the Z8K for my thesis project, but I plan to stick
with Zilog for a while to come (at least until the 68K shows me that it
uses it's registers a bit more efficiently).

It seems the Non Linear Systems Kaycomp II is now called the
Kaypro II.  At least that's what the unit I received recently
is labelled.  After about 5 days of use, here are my observations:

	1.  The case.  Not very pretty, but functional.  It's
constructed of painted aluminum and seems reasonably sturdy.  The
power cord is stored on the outside of the case wrapped around four
corner posts.  There is no storage for floppies ala Osborne.  Weight
is about 24 lbs.

	2.  The keyboard.  One of the best features of the machine.
Very similar to a VT-100.  Codes generated by cursor arrows or any
key on the numeric pad can be re-defined.  The keyboard touch is
excellent.  Keyboard attaches with a nice long coiled telephone
style cord with standard modular connectors at both ends.  Caps lock
key has a red LED indicator.

	3.  The display.  Good news and bad news.  The good news is it
produces a highly readable 80X24 display on a 9" P31 green screen.  The
memory mapped display is very fast and apparently doesn't take up any
user address space (bank switched?).  The bad news is the annoying presence
of video "noise" on the screen during screen update (random flashes and
specks).  Also there are no video attributes available.

	4.  The disks.  The Kaypro uses two single sided double density
40 track mini floppies.  STAT will report 191K on a freshly formatted
disk.  Disk I/O seems to be fairly fast.  Disk copies and large program
loads go at a brisk pace.  A 5" Winchester option is in testing stages.

	5.  The CPU.  Removing the top cover reveals a single board
computer with a 2.5 MHz (why not 4 MHz?) Z80 CPU with 64K bytes of
RAM (8 64K chips).  Included are one serial port and one Centronics
parallel port.  The ports use Zilog SIO and PIO chips.  The floppy
controller is a 1791.  *ALL* chips are socketed.  Workmanship looks
good and servicability looks excellent.

	6.  The software.  The CP/M provided seems to be a reasonable
implementation.  The FORMAT and COPY utilities provided include verify
options and work well.  A BAUD program allows software definition of
the serial port baud rate.  Unfortunately, the CBIOS source code was
not provided.  I'm checking to see if it can be made available.  The
other software included is the SELECT word processor, SBASIC, PROFITPLAN,
and UTILYZE.  I'm not excited about SELECT, although it looks like it
might be a good choice for a non computer oriented person.  I will be
bringing up some other CP/M editors as soon as I load them over from
8" disks.  I haven't tried any of the other software yet, so can't
comment on it.

----Summary----

In general, it seems to be a great buy at $1795 list.  The Ozzie includes
a better package of software, but the Kaypro seems to have the edge on
hardware features.  How well it stands up remains to be seen.

	Regarding the previous article on differences between the 68000
and the 68010:  You should already know that the 68000 does not handle
instruction restart.  The only way you can implement a true Virtual
Memory architecture using the 68000 is to use two processors.  One

one is handling the exception.  You can optimize this a little,
but the code is very nasty (speaking from experience here).

	The 68010, then, needs no fancy hackery.  Like a PDP-11,
it can restart instructions.  Equipped with an MMU, you could handle
various forms of VM.  The SUN machine has an architecture which
lends itself nicely to dropping in a 68010 (pin-for-pin compatible
with the 68000, remember), and a little exception handling code,
and ending up with a much more powerful system.

	Seems like this has been explained before, somewhere.  I
can only hope the readers of this list are now enlightened.

A couple of months ago I posteda request for some info on cheap Z80
based micros to be used for word processing.  The upshot of my
search was that, except for the kit builder type, none are really
available now, though some will be available in a few months (notably
KAYCOMP II and Micro-Decisionware). Since I needed the capability
now, I thought some of you might find my solution {amusing|horrifying}.
I'm buying a KSR printer, and using a VAX for computer power.
The personal computer age just hasn't arrived quite yet.

I am beginning now to think about buying a 16-bit micro.  I will be
making the purchase next June, and I want to spend about $8-10K.
This is to include hard-disc, terminal, unix-software, and about
256K.  I realize that every week (just about) someone introduces
new systems, but I figure that it is the systems that are available
*now* that will be in good shape a year from now.  One other criteria
is that hardware/software support be available both here and overseas,
since this machine will probably be used in a commercial venture.
Strange to relate (on net.micro.68k, no less) I find the DEC-PC
very tempting in terms of price, performance and support.  My
"best-bet" system would be someone offering a 68000 board for the
DEC-PC.  An article in Mini-MIcro Systems seems to imply this latter
possibility is remote, saying that DEC will try to keep the specs on
the PC "private", to discourage outsider hardware.  With this long
introduction I come to my query(ies):

(1) Could all you people who have currently available 68K systems
with Unix send me mail on what you hardware/software configuration
is and how much these cost?

(2) If anyone is planning, or knows of someone who is planning a 68k
board for the DEC-PC, could you please send me info?

I am sure that my results will be of general interest, so I'll post
a summary to the net.  Hence, if anyone wants to keep any info
confidential, please indicate that in your response.

Hoping to hear from you all soon,

	Just a warning about the prices I posted earlier:  I have no idea
how firm they are.  (also, I think I meant ">" instead of "<").

	I have a spec sheet for the part.  It comes in a 40-pin pack.
They claim it to be totally source & object code compatible with the 68000,
and vice-versa.  Address and data busses are still non-multiplexed.  I
still don't have any performance information.

I have been using the Whitesmiths C compiler which runs on our
vax and generates code for the 68000.  It has downloading utilities
(that can generate S Records) and other items including an assembler
(non-standard) as part of the package.  While it is not the best in
the optimum code generation department, it is sufficient.

There are a few bugs in it, but I have been able to work around them.

I just, for the first time in my life, laid eyes on the new IBM PC.  WOW!
Leave it to IBM to make a personal computer that doesn't look like a refugee
from a hardware lab.  I was extremely impressed by the good integration
of the package/display.  I saw both the color and monochrome video display,
and the monochrome is a definite win.  Its much better than most video
terminals.  The keyboard is also a win, (excellent feel).  I was a little
disapointed in the low memory density provided, (16K elements), but that
is fixable by buying an outside memory board.  (256K with a serial and
parallel port is available outside).

A word of caution about IBM's async communications package however, the
software CANNOT hack terminal emulation at 1200 baud, (much less 2400), its
partially written in basic.  The excellent CROSS-TALK package is available
for CPM-86 (one of 3 OS's available, the best is M-DOS however).   A
C compiler is available, (but not thru IBM).  The COMPUTERLAND outlet in
Timonium has a good selection of software also.  In particular, VISICALC
and WORDSTAR are supposed to be real wins, (although expensive).

There are assembly language implementations of terminal handling done,
I would be particularly interested in one that emulates several popular
terminals, (VT-100, Concept 108, etc.).

One can implement dynamic stack growth via paging without being able
to restart aborted instructions.  Map unallocated pages to the same
"free" page in memory and set the memory management hardware to
generate an interrupt when a read/write occurs in this area (e.g.
when the stack grows downward into an "unallocated" page).  Rather
than aborting the "fault"-generating instruction in the middle,
allow it to complete (since it is reading/writing "real" memory),
and then (after it is done) an interrupt will occur.  Presumably the
MMU hardware will tell you the page that generated the fault.  If it
is above the SP, allocate the page and map another "free" page into
all of the "unallocated" slots.  If it is below the SP, generate a
segmentation violation signal and blow the process away.

A possible problem is a write onto a set of locations that cross a
page boundary.  If no uninterruptable instructions can write more than
a page-size's worth of bytes at once, then this problem can be solved
by using two "real" pages and mapping successive virtual pages to
alternate real ones.

The "Sextant" summer 1982, p.106 showes the architecture of the new Z-machines 
very clearly.  No way that I can see to upgrade a Z/H-19 to this impressive 
new family of micros.  However, the Super 89 from D-G Electronic 
Developments Co. 700 S. Armstrong, Denison, TX 75020, (214)-465-7805 (Brian

What they mean is that their memory management will be able to handle the 68010
not that their boards will currently allow demand paging. As it stands, they
point out that they can not handle this, and that you need to wait for the
68010 for full paging. The system can handle paging of either just data or
instructions (I don't remember which) currently.

I got a request to describe the systems that I thought were much better than
Unix and hope will be available by the time the hardware to run them reaches
affordable prices. The following is my (belated) reply. I thought it of
enough interest to be posted to the lists. My apologies to those who
get it twice.

Eden, smalltalk, etc. are representatives of the what I hope will be the
next generation of operating systems. These systems are generically referred
to as "object" based systems. Their primary characteristic is that they
don't have file systems; everything in an object driven system is always in
memory, some memory is just slower than other memory.

Some of the features these systems can display:

	1) user supplied object topologies
	2) dynamic linking to objects
	3) I/O redirection by name substitution
	4) Automated desktop style command processors

These things imply some slick capabilities. User supplied topologies
means that I can organize my `files' any way I please, using any naming
convention I want. Dynamic linking to objects means that if a bug gets
fixed in a library, I won't have to relink programs that use the
library; they'll pick the new one up when I run them. Finally, I/O
redirection by name means that you can do things like

	"run this program; when it asks for object klaatu, give it
	object barado instead"

Similar magic should apply to subroutine linkage, etc.

Smalltalk is a language/system (similar to BASIC in the binding of the
operating system and the language) developed by Xerox, to be release to the
public "soon". The Rossetta Corporation has an implementation of Smalltalk
'76 on a z80. See the August '81 issue of Byte for information.

Eden is a system being worked on by a group of people at the University of
Washington. It is designed to run on 1 to 4 iAPX-432's (gulp) as part of a
local ethernet system. One of the aims of the Eden project is to build a
good environment for doing CS research.  See the Proceedings of the Eigth
Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (December '81 OSR) for
information.

The etc include iMAX-432, being developed by Intel for the iAPX-432. This is
the only object driven system currently available to the public. For
information, check the Eigth SOSP mentioned above.

In addition, I have been playing with the idea of putting some form of
object driven system on my current (z80) hardware. It's not clear that such
a thing is possible. The lack of a hard disk is particularly noticeable.

   I just talked to Andy Bell at the Wellesley Heathkit Center.  He says
it's very unlikely (probably not possible) to directly upgrade an H19 to
the Z100.  The Z100 has 5 slots instead of three, and has a much larger
board that he doesn't think would fit in the H19 cabinet.

   He did suggest an alternative for those interested in upgrading to
something more powerful than the H89.  The Wellesley Center (but not
Heathkit itself) will be offerring the D. G. Electronics Super-89 board
for $829.  It is designed to be an H89 upgrade kit.

   The Super-89 allows up to 256K bytes of RAM, and uses a Z80 at 4 MHz.
It has a real time clock and calendar, six I/O slots and two RS-232 ports.
It is compatible with HDOS and Magnolia systems; MP/M from D. G. will be
released soon.  In August, RAMdisk capability for the Super-89 will
become available.  The Super-89 meets F.C.C. Type B RFI specs.

   The Super-89 is supposedly mentioned in a Heathkit newsletter.  Andy
thought that a number of Heathkit Centers would probably start carrying it,
but Heath itself probably won't mention it.  Interested people may call
the Wellesley Heathkit Center, (617) 237-1510.  If you call, please

	And, does it use the same chassis as the H19?  Could I

The recent issue of 'PC Magazine' is distributing the listing of
an IBMPC basic programme which will double the speed of the
floppy disk's sold with the IBMPC.  The programme creates a file
called 'speedup.com' which patches disk timing parameters in the
IBM DOS to less conservative values.

15 NEXT: READ N: IF N <> C THEN 40

25 FIELD 1,1 AS N$: FOR I = 1 TO 37

35 NEXT: CLOSE: PRINT "CREATED": END
40 PRINT "**ERROR - VERIFY DATA**": END

70 END
 
This programme is on page 151, Volume 1, Number 3.
If you put the 'speedup' command in the autoexec.bat file
you can hear the disk's speed change immediately afterward.

We at the University of Oklahoma have a problem that I am certain that
others out there have run into. Namely, doing file uploads/downloads
from/to an IBM 370 like machine, running (of course) an os/370 like
operating system.

The problem with this is that the 370 talks to the outside world
through a magic beast called the 3705, which does nasty things, such as:

	1) Not accept a certain (unknown) set of control characters.
	2) Not accept input when it isn't listening.
	3) Has no flow control from the terminal end.

And need I go on?

Anyway, we need to send text and binary to/from this beast, from micros
ranging from apples & trs-80, through LSI 11's. We are in desperate
need of software to do this, and have found the following
(unacceptable) alternatives:

	1) Something from UCLA
	2) Something from Stanford
	3) Something from Waterloo
	4) Something homegrown

If anybody out there has something that works under the above
constraints, doing it all using only the 95 printable ascii characters
plus CR or NL, please let me know.

Cost constraints:

	1) IBM software needs to be free or cheap (< $1000)
	2) Micro software needs to be free, or givable away once we have
		it, plus relatively cheap.
	3) Micro software should be in a high level language, (Pascal or
		BASIC preferred), and easy to understand (whatever that
		means).

If enough interest is shown, I will summarize for the net.

	Thanx,
	mike

software will be plug compatible when the 68010 boards come out.
Will someone please explain?

I received several responses to my request for 68000 UNIX information.
The most important was a summary from aron shtull-trauring
(harpo!presby!aron) of the information he had received from his earlier
request.  The most significant new information is:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Consider this contribution annonymous:

            Radio Shack will be supplying what you want.  The target
    date is late November.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MIT, Stanford, Lucasfilm, SMI, Cadlink, and most likely
all the other SUN-based workstation companies all
offer some version or another of V7 UNIX for the 68000.

************

Unsubstantiated rumor claims that Microsoft is doing their usual half-assed
job bringing up Unix on the Tandy machine.  The TRS-80 mod 16's internal
architecture is pretty awful so even a good Unix might not run all that
well.


************  [The rest of this message is the previous summary.  B.J.]


As has been mentioned in WorkS, the 68000 doesn't really support paging
or even the automatic stack growth that UNIX uses.  So a *good* UNIX isn't
likely till the 68010 or 68020 are available.

The major problem is that an instruction that is aborted in the middle
by any sort of memory management fault cannot in general be restarted;
thus, demand paging is totally impossible.  On 11s, that isn't a problem,
but UNIX does depend on page faults on stack references to know when to
expand it.  This could be faked by including some restartable (or perhaps
unneeded) instruction at the entry to each block that would reference the
bottom of the new stack; that could force the expansion.  Of course, there
would be extra overhead for each subroutine call in that case.

Microsoft has committed to producing UNIX versions for all of the major
16-bit micros, including the 68000.  To the best of my knowledge, the
only one they're marketing now is for LSI-11/23s.  I strongly suspect
that they will wait until they can get a UNIX 3.0 -based system before
releasing any others.  Not that it's necessarily technically better, but
Bell's licensing terms (for them) are far superior.

The real problem, though, will be with the disk -- UNIX is a heavily
I/O-bound system, and can't really survive on floppies.  A 5-10M
Winchester is the minimum configuration, I'd say, that will really
support UNIX.

Several folks other than Microsoft are also planning "UNIX-like" systems.
I am told that HP will offer one; I don't know, though, if they're doing
it themselves or what.

************

     If you read WorkS digest you should have seen an entry about the
     Sun workstation. It is a 68000 based graphics work station and it
     supports Unix. You may be able to get the software for a TRS-80
     from the people at Stanford who are working on it.

************

Gee -- after saying it would be a while, I just saw an ad in the Feb. BYTE
for a 68000-based V7 UNIX system.  The ad is by "DUAL" -- no mention of
hard disks, but they list a beginning price of $8295.  The UNIX system is
by UNISOFT of Berkeley, CA.


************

        In Thomas/Yates (A User Guide to the Unix System, Publ. by Osborne-
McGraw-Hill in Berkeley) the following are listed:

Unix:
        (1) Microsoft, 400 108 Av., N.E., #200, Bellvue, WA 98004
                (XENIX--a Unix look-alike)
        (2) Uni-Soft, 2405 4 St., Berkeley, CA 94710
        (3) Mark Williams Co., 1430 W. Wrightwood Av., Chicago, IL 60614
                (COHERENT, an O/S based on Unix)
        (4) Whitesmiths, Ltd., 1780 B'way, #601, New York, NY 10019
                (IDRIS, an O/S based on Unix)
C:
        (1) Alcyon Corp., 8474 Commerce Ave., San Diego, CA 92121

        I'm certain there are many others.  I know Lucasfilms, (the Star
Wars Company!) has brought a 68000 Unix, but isn't supporting it; they
should be listed in the Marin County (area code 415) phone book.

************

UNIX on 68K... originally done at MIT, available from LUCASFILM,
(on a SUN MULTI-bus system), WICAT on their own 68K system, Microsoft
(XENIX) on a QBUS 68K board--soon on other processors, Fortune on their
own system (proprietary bus), plus a few more in progress...

************

Whitesmith's and lots of other people have 68000 based UNIX products.
There must have been almost a dozen vendors of that type of
gear at last week's UNIX conference.  Read BYTE for more
info on this kind of things.
                          ^ thing, not things.  Damn mail program.

************

*Unix has been brought up on a 68000. What I was suggesting was that if
 one was going to buy a Sun it would be better to wait for the
 68010 since demand paging gives one greater capabilities with respect
 to timesharing and having multiple processes running simultaneously.
 But 68000 Unix is up and running well from what I can discern.

************

Yes, the 3.0 license will allow cheaper Unices, but I suspect that most
vendors haven't converted yet; given how slowly Western moves, they may
not even have their licenses yet.  I'd give it a few more months.  I've
been told that a 3.0 license subsumes v7 and 32V, so presumably anyone
who's now marketing a v7-based system will be able to sell the same thing
under the new terms, but I'm not certain of that.

About Xenix:  yes, it is real UNIX v7.  They've rewritten some sections
for improved reliability and speed, and added some stuff, but as far
as I know, any program that runs under v7 should run just fine under it.
Based on my own experiences in transporting UNIX to other machines, I'd
guess that they're also cleaning up and reorganizing code some, so that
they can support multiple machines with just one set of common source code.
For example, very many programs have a hidden dependency on the sign bit
of char variables being propogated when assigned to an int; this causes
them to break on most non-DEC machines.


************

Well, here's what I could find out so far.

There are alot of people coming out with bundled hardware/software
systems involving 68000's and Unix.  Among these are WICAT, MicroDaSys,
Dual and Fortune.  It seems every week that there is an article in
INFOWORLD announcing a new system of this sort.  In fact, in this
weeks INFOWORLD there is an article on Unix and 16 bit micros.  Most
of the above companies have full page adds in this months BYTE.

The problem, however, for the 16, is that these systems are bundled.
The hardware and software come together.  Most of these companies
are getting Unix from two places (on an OEM basis): UNISOFT in
Berkeley, CA and Microsoft in Bellevue, WA.

UNISOFT is currently V7 but will soon be Version III (or whatever
WE calls its latest concoction).  Even nicer, UNISOFT includes
the Berkeley Unix enhancements.  MICROSOFT is also V7 and I believe
will also soon be III, but does not include Berkeley stuff, although
it does have "internals" enhancements of its own.

Neither MICROSOFT nor UNISOFT is interested in selling single user
copies.  They'll only talk to you if you are an OEM.  On the other
hand, the OEM's will only sell you Unix for a 68000 inside their
own hardware.  According to the INFOWORLD article, the new WE
licensing arrangement will allow resale prices of $40 a copy for
dealers who've shelled out the $45,000 for the source-code license.

At those prices its understandable that dealers are relunctant to
sell Unix without the hardware.  There's no profit in it!

Anyway, unless someone out there has alot of money and time, and
is willing to become a TANDY and UNISOFT(or MICROSOFT) OEM, or
unless TANDY pleasantly surprises me, it may be a while before
we see Unix on the TRS-80 16.

************

Xenix 3.0 will be available for the 68000.  Xenix 2.2 (V7) is currently
ported to the 68000, but none of the machines are ready to be shipped
(one, in fact, will never be retailed to the public).  We're doing
a version for a SUN board (very sexy!) which should be complete in
6 weeks, on the streets in another 6 or 8, however fast the OEM
moves.  The second factor is the timing of Xenix 3.0, since we want
to combine some elements of Berkeley 4.1 in the release.  I expect
it will be third quarter before XENIX 3.0 is available.  Thus, 68000s
will be available sooner, but with XENIX 2.3.

As for the TRS 68000 machine, it has no memory management in its
current form.  We probably won't do anything with it until a version
with an MMU is available.

I dont understand your question about 'paging restrictions'.  If you
mean virtual memory, we will not support that until we have a real
virtual chip, either the 68010 or the 16032.  One of our OEMs,
MicroDaSys, is porting their own kernal to a 68000, and are doing
a dual-cpu virtual implimentation, where a second CPU wakes up on
a page fault, brings in the page, and lets the second one resume
from its amazingly long memory-access wait state.  I think that this
is a highly specialized system, as it does not provide general
virtual memory performance.

If you mean the fearsome restrictions in the 68000's MMU archetecture
(the Motorolla MMU chip), we've lost a lot of sleep over that design,
and we believe that we have some approaches and techniques to handle
the problem.

As for cost, the price is set by the OEM.  Since our price to them
is quite low, I would expect the OEMs to offer a very attractive price.
Many of them plan on a nice low price for the basic system, with
additional charges for some items which they hold back, such as
(for example) yacc/lex, screen editor, etc.  Our price to the
OEM is very close to the Bell price to us, which was published by
Bell at the last Usenix.  For a 15 user system, its around $300 or
so, roughly.

The TRS-80 Color Computer has four built in A/D channels (for the joysticks)
with 6 bit resolution between 0 and 5 volts. They are not particularly
fast (you didn't say what speed you needed) - say less than 10 samples per
second (if that).

   A 32K color computer is about $700 (they just dropped the price), your
first mini-floppy is $600 and each successive one (up to 4) is $400.
(The first drive includes the disk interface.)

Here's the best part: You don't have to mess with primitive processors
like Z-80's or 6502's - the CC has a 6809 in it.

I own one and have been pretty happy with it (though the inability to
put both text and graphics on the screen at the same time is a
considerable annoyance).

         Info. on bugs / operation hints

The following are some hints and some bugs that were discovered
while doing a small I/O task under RMX-88 (V. 2.0) for the 432.  If
these are already published and widely known, please excuse.

   1.	Current version of ICU-88 (V. 2.0) runs on the RPB-86.
	Current manual (03) does not match this version, i.e. 
	does not mention the 'RUN' command to get on the RPB-86.

   2.	The submit file that is generated by ICU-88 has 2 bugs:

	a)   STACKSIZE (0) should be STACKSIZE (4)
	b)   NOIC (no init code) should be included as a control 
	     on the LOCATE command.
       	
	Use CREDIT to fix.

   3.   You nust answer 'yes' to terminal handler and free space
	manager queries on ICU-88 due to iMAX-432 referencing them.

   4.	Only the non-megabyte version of RMX-88 is supported with
	iMAX at this time.  See pg. 1 of the RMX-88 manual.  I
	suggest you follow the manuals suggestion for the use of
	LOCATION and LOCATION$OF.

   5. 	What other 432 libraries must be included in the LINK LIST
	query is not documented at this time, so I suggest you
	link in IPCTRL.LNK, SUP1TH.LNK, and INIT1.OBJ assuming
	support for 1 terminal.  See pg. SUM-3 and SUM-4 of the iMAX
	manual.

   6.  	A warning of "DECREASING SIZE OF SEGMENT" by the locate 
	operation will be displayed.  

   7.	You must not input the RQOUTX and RQINPX exchanges on the
	EXCHANGE query on ICU-88.  They are automatically taken care
	of when you answer yes to the terminal handler queries.
	You must include your response exchanges unless you
	dynamically create them with RQCXCH.

   8.	The TASK NAME query must be 6 or less characters.  If
	greater than 6, it ignores the whole thing and doesn't warn
	you.  The stack name should be the task name concatonated
	with the word STACK.

   9.	All PLM-86 generated tasks must be COMPACT.

   10.	When using ICE-86A to debug the AP software you must add
	the following commands to the normal 86/12A mapping
	sequence:
		
			*RWT = INF
			*MAP 512 TO 576 = USER

	This allows Multi-bus accesses to the IP board and includes
	the 64K space for windows.

which makes 68000 based virtual memory machines (if you haven't figured out
who it is you probably aren't interested in 68000s).  I saw a 12 MHz  68000
(which  wasn't  quite working--at least in their test bed) and the spec for

	I'd like to stimulate some discussion on this list about
people's experiences with UNIX on the 68000.  Good or bad.  Performance,
reliability, viability in the commercial environment, etc.  

	Measurements on Fortune's 32:16 (runs at about 5.6MHz) seem
to put it about in a league with a PDP 11/34, performance-wise.  This
is with a DMA 5.25" Winchester as the root/swap media.  If there are
some benchmarks available generally, it would be interesting to
run them on a variety of 68K-based machines.

	This newsgroup is hereby established, with the following
purpose in mind:  Discussion of hardware and software relating to
the world of the Motorola 68000 family.

	All discussion of 68000 related things in net.micro should
move to this list.

	The responses in favor of a net.micro.68k were very good.
Some people would rather have seen a "16-bit oriented" list.  However,
I for one am only interested in 68000's.  There is very little going
on with other 16 bit machines that I'm interested in.  From the
volume of queries I've had about 68K related software & systems,
I would say there are others in boat.  I have no objection to there
also being a 'net.micro.16k' or 'net.micro.86' if there's enough
intereset in these other chips.  I think it might also be a good idea
to create a 'net.micro.80' for the 8080/Z80 world.

Sorry, Larry@sri-unix, I must contradict you;  the way I read Jerry's
article was that it was the key between shift and Z that really hit
him hard, on the grounds that it makes the keyboard unworkable for a
touch typist.  (Not strictly true, one can adapt to it, but close.)
It may not have been his first complaint but it was the most serious.

(Could anyone who wishes to flame further on this dig out the article
and check the actual wording first?  My copy is not where I can get at
it right now, or I would have checked.)

Thanks to all that responded to my request.  The last word heard on
the subject was a Usenet article August 31, 1981 from Lauren Weinstein
(Lauren@UCLA-SECURITY) to the ARPANET unix-wizards (fa.unix-wizards)
newsgroup.  The word then was that a CP/M uucp was almost complete for
a product to be called MARC (a UNIX-like system for CP/M ?).  A later
article tells of MARC bring almost ready for market.  Too many almost's
to handle the UNIX to/fro CP/M mail and file transfer.

A friend of mine who owns a "stereo store" is considering accquiring a
small computer system to help with things like inventory, accounting,
mailing lists, etc.  He has about $5000 to spend and is in somewhat of
a quandry as to what to do.  The only real criteria are that the system
be able to support the above functions, has reasonable expandability,
and good reliability.  He also wants a printer, letter quality is not
required, something with an overlapping dot matrix would be suitable.

The present frontrunner is the TRS-80 Model III with a couple of
disks.

Any and all advice will be appreciated, please respond in the next couple
days if possible.  (I'm moving out of town in about a week.)

is similar to the Intel 8080.  It is best if the compiler

The TRS-80 Color Computer has four built in A/D channels (for the joysticks)
with 6 bit resolution between 0 and 5 volts. They are not particularly
fast (you didn't say what speed you needed) - say less than 10 samples per
second (if that).

   A 32K color computer is about $700 (they just dropped the price), your
first mini-floppy is $600 and each successive one (up to 4) is $400.
(The first drive includes the disk interface.)

Here's the best part: You don't have to mess with primitive processors
like Z-80's or 6502's - the CC has a 6809 in it.

I own one and have been pretty happy with it (though the inability to
put both text and graphics on the screen at the same time is a
considerable annoyance).

         Info. on bugs / operation hints

The following are some hints and some bugs that were discovered
while doing a small I/O task under RMX-88 (V. 2.0) for the 432.  If
these are already published and widely known, please excuse.

   1.	Current version of ICU-88 (V. 2.0) runs on the RPB-86.
	Current manual (03) does not match this version, i.e. 
	does not mention the 'RUN' command to get on the RPB-86.

   2.	The submit file that is generated by ICU-88 has 2 bugs:

	a)   STACKSIZE (0) should be STACKSIZE (4)
	b)   NOIC (no init code) should be included as a control 
	     on the LOCATE command.
       	
	Use CREDIT to fix.

   3.   You nust answer 'yes' to terminal handler and free space
	manager queries on ICU-88 due to iMAX-432 referencing them.

   4.	Only the non-megabyte version of RMX-88 is supported with
	iMAX at this time.  See pg. 1 of the RMX-88 manual.  I
	suggest you follow the manuals suggestion for the use of
	LOCATION and LOCATION$OF.

   5. 	What other 432 libraries must be included in the LINK LIST
	query is not documented at this time, so I suggest you
	link in IPCTRL.LNK, SUP1TH.LNK, and INIT1.OBJ assuming
	support for 1 terminal.  See pg. SUM-3 and SUM-4 of the iMAX
	manual.

   6.  	A warning of "DECREASING SIZE OF SEGMENT" by the locate 
	operation will be displayed.  

   7.	You must not input the RQOUTX and RQINPX exchanges on the
	EXCHANGE query on ICU-88.  They are automatically taken care
	of when you answer yes to the terminal handler queries.
	You must include your response exchanges unless you
	dynamically create them with RQCXCH.

   8.	The TASK NAME query must be 6 or less characters.  If
	greater than 6, it ignores the whole thing and doesn't warn
	you.  The stack name should be the task name concatonated
	with the word STACK.

   9.	All PLM-86 generated tasks must be COMPACT.

   10.	When using ICE-86A to debug the AP software you must add
	the following commands to the normal 86/12A mapping
	sequence:
		
			*RWT = INF
			*MAP 512 TO 576 = USER

	This allows Multi-bus accesses to the IP board and includes
	the 64K space for windows.

people's experiences with UNIX on the 68000.  Good or bad.  Performance,
reliability, viability in the commercial environment, etc.  

	Measurements on Fortune's 32:16 (runs at about 5.6MHz) seem
to put it about in a league with a PDP 11/34, performance-wise.  This
is with a DMA 5.25" Winchester as the root/swap media.  If there are
some benchmarks available generally, it would be interesting to
run them on a variety of 68K-based machines.

	This newsgroup is hereby established, with the following
purpose in mind:  Discussion of hardware and software relating to
the world of the Motorola 68000 family.

	All discussion of 68000 related things in net.micro should
move to this list.

	The responses in favor of a net.micro.68k were very good.
Some people would rather have seen a "16-bit oriented" list.  However,
I for one am only interested in 68000's.  There is very little going
on with other 16 bit machines that I'm interested in.  From the
volume of queries I've had about 68K related software & systems,
I would say there are others in boat.  I have no objection to there
also being a 'net.micro.16k' or 'net.micro.86' if there's enough
intereset in these other chips.  I think it might also be a good idea
to create a 'net.micro.80' for the 8080/Z80 world.

I read an interview of Steve Wozniak(sp?) co founder of Apple in the
latest issue of creative computing.  In it he describes his woes of
being an undergraduate at Berkeley (he has to take clases under a false
name) and he talks a little about the Apple IV.  The Apple IV is 68000
based (as was reported many times earlier).  He said that they had done
some things to make in faster in transfering data through its 16 bit
data bus (I'm not sure I understood).  He said that it is in its final
stages but that the last 10% might take any amount of time.  Evidently
they are mostly finishing up on software (like windowing, word
processing, etc.)  It looks like Apple is going to generate a lot of in
house software and not rely on outsides vendors as it did with the Apple
II.  The only hardware not finished is the high density drives which he
said they've had problems with for the past two years.  (Is Apple really
making its own drives?)  The Apple IV looks very exciting and if they
can keep it at a reasonable price (under 6K) it should do very well.

I heard from someone that IBM came out with a 68000 box a couple of
weeks ago called something like ADVENTURE.  I haven't read anything
about it and so really doubt it but the source sounded very sure about
it. 

Replys to info-micro, not to me.  Let's generate more rumors on this list.

While I have not used the Intertec Superbrain, I did work for a company at 
one time that used the Intertube II. I ran into the following problems with
the terminals at one time or another:

1) Intertec has a policy of warranties from manufacture date, not purchase
   date.. This means that most if not all of your warranty can be used up 
   while the terminal is on the manufacturers shelf (I found that 25-40
   days of actual warranty was typical).

2) Intertec seems to have a policy of shipping DOA's. Fully 30% of the
   terminals did not function on initial delivery. Intertec was VERY slow
   in repair. I found that we could easily rely on them taking 3-5 months
   to repair a DOA (not replace it), therefore removing any warranty left
   over when we got it (since they did not extend or renew warranties on 
   repair).

3) When we finally got fed up with their service, we ordered a set of
   schematics from the company (for something like $125<!>) so that we could
   hire someone locally to fix them. There were four different revision
   levels of schematics on various pages for the SAME board. After doing 
   some research,  we found out that NONE of them came close to matching
   the terminal we really had. Upon discussing this fact with Intertec, we
   were told to return the schematics for replacement/refund. This we did,
   by certified mail with a reply letter. To date, Intertec has not admitted
   receiving them, telling us to return them, or mailing them in the first
   place.

4) Our final order of Intertube's was for 12. 11 of them arrived DOA. We 
   notified Intertec that they were not acceptable, we were returning them,
   we would NOT pay for them, and that we would not order any in the future.
   We also asked for return instructions (since we were not returning them
   for repairs which we had memorized by that time). Their reply, through 
   their lawyers, was that if we didn't pay within 30 days, they would seek
   payment through small claims court. We replied, to their lawyers, that we 
   would be MORE than happy to return the terminals (with our reasons) and
   that as soon as the lawyers approved, they could expect the terminals in 
   their law offices via UPS. We have not yet received a reply for that (its
   been about 2 years).

5) All the above is mainly about the company, which I have heard has not 
   changed much. As far as the actual terminal (which may or may not relate
   to the Superbrain): The user manuals were unreadable, incomprehensible,
   and usually incorrect. the cursor controls documented rarely matched the
   way the firmware implemented them.

6) The firmware was unbelievable buggy. The hardware was under-designed and
   prone to failure. It generated spurious characters, had a tendency to 
   lock its keyboard, and generally made life miserable. The fastest we could
   reliably run the terminal with minimal cursor controls (XY and Form Feed)
   was 1200 baud. One of its best features was that it was possible to change
   the internal clock speed to match 50Hz or 60Hz from the keyboard. It also
   seemed to like to generate that code spuriously, causing some of the most 
   interesting screen graphic displays I have ever seen (on a non-graphics 
   terminal.


They might have changed the way they do things since then. I don't know.
From what I have HEARD, the only way to buy a Superbrain is to find a
reliable dealer who will ship you the unit directly from the factory
(rather than his stock), and will extend the warranty from his own
pocket. From the track record I have had with the firm, I would not be
caught DEAD with anything by the company, and you could not give it to
me.

One quarter of Intel's booth space at the National Computer
Conference, held early last month in Houston, was devoted to the
iAPX-432 Micromainframe.  

The workhorse of the demonstration was a System 432/670 with two
GDP's while an iSBC 86/12A attached processor controlled the 
peripheral subsystem, servicing the user terminals.

Five CRT screens prompted attendees to choose from among eight
different programs:
    
     system status    --   the display showed which program was
                           active at each terminal while a bar
			   graph shrank and expanded to track
			   processor usage
     
     guess the animal --   the user thought of an animal and the
                           computer tried to guess it in this
			   amusing version of 20 Questions

     life             --   generations lived, reproduced, and died
                           in this popular biological game

     towers of Hanoi  --   the processing speed of the 432 was 
			   graphically illustrated by this acient
			   puzzle

     vertical roll    --   the user typed a message and it scrolled
                           vertically across the screen

     horizonal roll   --   the user typed a message and it scrolled
                           horizonally across the screen
     
     big clock        --   a digital clock tracked each passing
                           second in a full-screen display
     
     background       --   this unattended program sampled the
                           other programs and displayed text
			   explaining 432 features

The GDPs shared the system workload, executing processes according 
to a round-robin schedule; a separate process serviced each terminal.

The 432 demonstration was designed to support 40 simultaneous
users, although booth space limited the system to five.

The demonstration attracted many high-level managers interested in
learning more about the 432.  The most frequent questions were about
Ada, although many attendees were intrigued by the 432's object-oriented
architecture.

Any questions or comments?  How many of you saw the NCC demo?

I strongly disagree with your evaluation . My wife has used a
Vector 2600 since Nov 81 as the word processor in her translating
business.  She is extremely happy with it.  She uses the memorite
word processor supplied with the machine.  She translates at over
100 words a minute (typed text) so the wordstar word processore
gave her problems due to the wrap around problem.  I showed her
your message.  Her comment was that you were talking about a
different machine , are you ? Her main reason for selecting the
vector over other pc7s was the feel of the keyboard.  Her
previous experience had been on a selectric 1. She finds the
Vector 3 keyboard more to her liking.  After 9 months of
translating Russian, Bulgarian, FRench, Italian,Serbian, Polish
and what ever into english on the machine and producing about 12
megabytes of final text on the Nec 7700 she has yet to have a
problem.  The disks (tandon double side 96 tpi have so far worked
flawlessly).  Another point of view, from me.  At NRL in my group
we make extensive use of micros, we have 4 chromemcos., 2 apples,
3 pdp 11/40 and 1 vector 5005.  I have found the vector superior
to all but the pdp's for our simple data analysis problems and
machine control applicaions.  It ad the chromemco's are very much
the same, however the 6 mhz z80 helps us quite a bit in certain
applications.  Again were you talking about the recent Vector
releases or their older mz version?

In response to Leonard@sri-unix's request for info. here is
what I know. I have a A/D board from Tecmar which has 
functioned with out any problems for a couple of years now.
The board I have runs 8 dual inputs, or 16 single, has a
10 microsecond conversion time, and 12 bit accuracy. The
zero is very solid, almost no drift. I got an S-100 bus
made by HUH with the board so I could hook it up to my
TRS-80. The HUH S-100 to TRS-80 bus board (with power supply,
box, fan, etc.) works well, and has four slots. So I can add
three other S-100 boards to the TRS-80 if I ever need to.
I am now using the A/D board with an LNW-80 at the higher
clock speed of 4MHz. The only trouble I had when I switched
computers from TRS-80 to LNW80 was with the cable connecting
the HUH to the computer. I had to shorten it from 5 feet to
about 3 feet. Everyone says it should be less than one foot,
but I have had no problems with a 3 foot cable. For more
info. I suggest you call Tecmar and tell them what you want
and get current information. Mine is a little out of date.
Their phone number is 216-464-7410. They have an add in
this month's issue of Byte too. I think they also make a
Apple version of some of their boards. They make more expensive
A/D boards (about $1000) which have amplifiers built in, and
have 16 bit accuracy. The best reason for using a LNW80 I have
found is the 480x192 pixel display lets you plot the data as
you take it. This can be a big help. 
  The Tecmar board is on the whole a very good board and it works
well with the TRS80 or LNW80, but even when life is a bowl of
cherries, you have to watch out for pits. In this case, the
problem is with using the real time clock. If you use the
computer's real time clock, you can not do I/O which disables
interupts! So if you are timing your measurements you can not
write the results to disk or tape! I am working on a way around
this limitation, but have not yet settled on a solution. If 
anyone else out there in net land has beat this problem, let us
know the solution.

I spent about half a year trying to make various things work on the
vector graphics machine. There were two problems I had that will
definitely concern someone trying to do text processing:

	1) The BIOS traps some control characters (at least, that's
		what it looked like to me). This will make implementing
		a screen editor painful.
	2) The keyboard layout for there terminals stink. I pity anyone
		who uses anything reasonable (including an IBM
		selectric) and then tries to use one of these.

Len, at NYU we are using Apples for a similar applications with two
set-ups - a board set from Interactive Microware in Pa. and a complete
chassis that sits on the Apple from Cyborg in the Boston area; both
seem to do fine but the former is a cheaper way to go and it is less
professionally packaged (and cheaper) than the former. Both of these
suppliers advertise heavily in the magaizines so you should have
little trouble locating them. If you cannot find their phone numbers,
I'll look around. The material is not at easy reach since other labs
are involved. I must plead total ignorance on Radio Shack!

One problem anyone buying one of the DEC Personal Computers should be
aware of:  they have the same awful design mistake as the IBM PC in the
keyboard layout -- a key between SHIFT and Z.  Some people find they
adapt to this quickly;  some find such a keyboard totally unacceptable.
Jerry Pournelle called the IBM PC the biggest disappointment of his
life, for this and only this reason.

The moral is:  do not believe brochures that claim a "standard typewriter"
keyboard layout;  it ain't necessarily so.

The reason that the 8 MHz versions of the 68000 ran less than
half the speed of the 16 MHz version is because of wait states.
I believe I said that the two 8 MHz machines tested ran with
2 and 4 wait states, respectively.

Also, in the machine descriptions given I said that the VAX
was a 780.

I have a possible use for a micro, of either the TRS-80 or Apple
persuasion, for a scientific application.  The choice of which micro I
use is highly dependent on which can talk to an A/D converter that is
currently available (I have neither the time nor the desire to design
my own A/D converter for this application), and on price and
programming considerations if such a device is available for both
computers.

Specifically, I need information about a two-channel A/D converter
(one channel may do if I can get one bit of output to control an
analog switch to multiplex the A/D input, and more than two channels
aren't needed but will be tolerated if the only units come with more),
which generates one byte output (either signed or unsigned) in around
50 microseconds or less.  The input from the application will be on
the order of tenths of microvolts, but I expect to preamplify it to
whatever range the A/D converter requires, since I doubt that any
available for these computers can handle such low-level signals .

I need price, address, phone numbers, and descriptions of A/D hardware
for any micro of this sort, and I need to build this thing yesterday.

If no such device exists, suppliers of any parallel A/D converter
assembly (again, I don't want to have to start from just a chip unless
the design time will be very small) and parallel interfaces for either
micro would be greatly appreciated.

Any other information you throw in about the suitability of either
type of computer for this application (how easy it is to interface to,
how much equally configured systems including 48K or 64K RAM and two
5.5" drives cost relative to each other) would be appreciated but can
probably be obtained through other channels.

If anyone can give me some information, my undying gratitude!  And
thanx much, too!

Re:   Epson Printers(long message)

Well it seems that nobody has a New Epson...they now come with an
EXTREMELY well written manual.  In addition to a tutorial style which
is very well written there is an excellent Appendix section which has
everything I could every ask for.  Just a sampling:

Appendix B - Control Codes: ALL!  of the control codes are listed.

Appendix R - GRAFTRAX+ ROM Set Installation Instructions: Do you
believe they actually tell you how to install the GRAFTRAX+
EPROMS(that's right - Epson uses EPROMS not ROMS - 3 2716s to be
exact).  This installation procedure will allow you to upgrade ANY
MX80, MX80F/T, or MX100 to have GRAFTRAX+.  I have an original MX80
and an older MX100(GRAFTRAX not +) which I have now upgraded and they
work fantastically!...To get copies of the EPROMS I just popped out
the ones from the new MX100(they are socketed) and copied them.

The options available are really nice...I would like to know what is
the reason for wanting to use the 128 ASCII character set for the
MX80F/T-what character should be printed for control-B for instance?

Things are looking up in the area of communications packages for the IBM PC!

    If you are one of the frustrated buyers of IBM's "Asynchronous Communi-
cations Support" (ACS) programs, you may be interested in a good patch kit
offered by Microcorp of Philadelphia. Called COMMPLUS, it is what the IBM
product should have been in the first place. I have had mine only a few days,
so I can't offer a thorough review. What I can say is that it is a significant
step in the right direction from the ACS.

    The most important improvement for my uses is the upload/download
facility. You open the file to be written to / read from using the F2 key and
its associated menu (which includes an option to review the disk directory),
then return to terminal ops. There you are greeted with an intense flashing
L or a 'normal' U on the status line (line 25) right next to
 - another feature -  the "F5=HELP  time  date" prompt. (Also included on the
bottom line are error messages and a "P" indicator when the printer repeat
 - F7 - is on and/or an "H" for hex listings - F6.)
    The flashing "L" signifies that any incoming characters will be captured
by your disk file, and it may be toggled on and off using the F10 key. So all
you have to do to download a file from UNIX is open the disk file as above,
toggle the file closed, type "CAT unix filespec", F10, <enter>. Then sit back
and read what's going into the file (or else take a potty break because 300
baud is VERY slow).

    Uploading is just as easy. The 'normal' U means that the file is primed
and cocked and just waiting for you to hit the F9 key to start it heading
out. For UNIX operations simply enter edit for the desired filespec and "a"
for append where you want the data to go. You can use the F9 key at any time
to pause the transfer and do something else. One missing feature here that
I've seen on ST80III for the TRS-80 is the variable transmission speed ability.
Evidently that could be important for some applications where the receiving
system is REALLY slow.

    Another good feature is that COMMPLUS supports the Hayes Smartmodem auto-
dial capabilities. Have a list of up to 9 phone numbers and log-on lines
ready when you initialize the program - initially - and they will always be
there for you at the flick of the F8 key. I emphasize the "initial" because
the phone numbers are made part of your program when you apply the patches
at the outset. I haven't investigated what plumbing would be necessary to
change the list at some later date.

    If you have a 64k machine you have to give up the TSO and VM/370
and half-duplex options in the terminal selection menu. With 96 or 128k of RAM
it relocates the RS232INT.BAS above the 64k boundary and you get to keep all
of your options. It wasn't a hard choice for me. You can always use the plain
ACS program for TSO and VM/370 work, and you won't have wrong-key-itis, as
all the function keys do the same things (where enabled) in both programs.
It's interesting that the - very useful in my eyes - printer toggle option
was actually buried in the ACS program, but not implemented.

    I have continually mentioned the speed - or lack of it - at 300 baud. This
is not the program's fault, although the authors do acknowledge in a cover
letter with the documentation that the keyboard response is a little slow.
This is evidently due to the nature of the basic algorithms for outputing
the data. You can select up to 9600 baud as a line bit rate, but I had no way
to test anything other than 300 because of my modem.

    Speaking of the documentation, I would have to describe it as thorough but
unimaginative. A large portion of the 30 pages is dedicated to the portion
of the program in which the patches are applied to ACS. This is the thorough
part, and I think anyone who has produced the ante for a PC should have enough
savvy to follow the directions. A little "background" on the evolution of the
program follows, and then a description of each function. This section was
not what I would call a "thriller". I sorta skipped over it. There were a
bunch of long paragraphs, type-written, not type-set, that I just couldn't
bring myself to read. Reckon what features I missed?

    One thing I did catch is that you can press <end> ( # 1) and then F8, and
if you have a Smartmodem, it will hang up for you. Sometimes I have trouble
getting UNIX to turn me loose (it generates a new ";login:" prompt after I've
said bye). And I never have been successful getting the "+++" technique to
put me back in command mode so I could hang up - one of those really frustrat-
ing little problems. Anyway, COMMPLUS does it for me now. How do YOU hang up a  direct-connect modem when the host computer keeps making its carrier?

    The documentation is rounded out with several pages describing what is
happening in each section of code. This is certainly thoughtful on the part
of the programmers; they obviously realize the old maxim about no perfect
communications program, and have facilitated us hackers whacking away on theirs.
The thoroughness returns in the last section, as they have provided a hand-
holding tutorial to get you through a sample session of 'communicating'.

    Two things in closing. The terminal selection menus allow a choice between
monochrome and color monitors. It supports 40-character screens. 2. Included
with the documentation is a blurb about INTELLITERM which will evidently be
a machine-language version of the package similar to what they now offer for
the TRS-80. COMMPLUS cost $25. + an incredible -in my eyes- $5. shipping.
My invoice said I could get full credit towards the INTELLITERM at a later
date. I guess they are working feverishly to get it "out the door".
Enough.

    I ordered a Corvus Concept at the beginning of July although I
haven't received it yet (delivery is supposed to be the end of July).
I did get to see it at the dealer's however, so here are a few observations:

1.  The system comes with a 68000 Operating system, a 68000 assembler,
    and a native code Pascal compiler. ANSI 77 FORTRAN, Edword word
    processor, or Logicalc electronic spreadsheet are extra cost.

2.  The source language for the Pascal compiler appears to be UCSD Pascal.
    The brochure lists it as "ISO Pascal with UCSD extensions".
    Also, 'Logicalc' is a trademark of (I forget who) and is a UCSD program.
    'Corvus Logicalc' is a trademark of the 68000 code version.

3.  The operating system uses UCSD file structures, a tree structured
    directory, and the shell is very similar to the UNIX shell.

4.  You can define a window anywhere on the screen and this may overlap
    previosly defined windows. We didn't play with this too much.
    Actually, the dealer had only had the system for a few days and he
    hadn't had a chance to play with it much either.

5.  When we arrived at the dealer's, the Concept was running a program
    which was drawing a perspective plot of a sinc function of revolution.
    It looked quite nice but the plotting speed was rather slow. I don't
    know anything about what language the program as written in and what
    affect this might have had on the speed. The display is 560x720.

6.  The display is a 15" diag., 35MHz, white phosphor monitor. The monitor
    is memory mapped and uses DMA.  All characters are software generated
    and you can define your own. The display can be used in either a
    horizontal (56lines x 120chars/line) or vertical (72x90) orientation.
    This requires rebooting the operating system however.

7.  The keyboard is also memory mapped. It generates an interrupt whenever
    a key is pressed or released.

8.  The keyboard, monitor, and drivers take about 55Kbyte.

9.  Presently you can get either a 256Kb or 512Kb memory system.  Corvus is
    working on a larger memory board for it though (at least 1Mbyte).  The
    system does not use a mother board.  The extra 256Kb memory card connects
    via a ribbon cable.

10. The four expansion slots take Apple peripheral controllers!

11. I'll let you know more once I get a chance to play with mine.

    One item about the Corvus Concept I forgot to mention was how they
achieve their claim of CP/M compatibility.  This is done by emulating a
Z-80.  The raw processor speed of this emulation is about the same as a
1MHz Z-80.  However, since IO calls are handled by the regular 68000 IO
routines, most CP/M programs (if they do IO) run about the same speed as
a 2MHz Z-80 system.  So if you HAVE to have access to the CP/M software
base, this is what's available.

Has anyone out there (esp. in Intel land) gotten the AP software for the
432/670 system supplied with iMAX V2 to work?  If so, I would appreciate
some pointers.

I am refering to the 8086 code running on the iSBC86/12A in the 670
chassis that drives the terminal port for the 670.   I have compiled
and linked ada programs successfully with the terminal_interfaces
library, and loaded the "TERM1" image to the 86/12, but when I get
the 432 program loaded and executing all it does is sit an look at me...

Is there any external indication that iMAX and TERM1 have linked up and
are on talking terms? (Like the startup message iMAX leaves on the
debugger console?)

Any help would be appreciated...

   The timings for the 16Mhz M68000 vs the VAX were probably correct.
If you notice, the Motorola M68000 clocked at 16Mhz had no wait states.
Presumably, a M68000 clocked at 8Mhz opitimized to have no wait states
would run exactly 1/2 as fast as the Motorola timings for a 16Mhz
processor or about .87 of a VAX.

(observation care of lanl-a/jhf)

CU, I think, would feel that consumers may or may not be novices.
In addition, they are, as Byron pointed out, not naive.  Therefore, I
imagine that they can use or not use information as theu see fit.  If
they data from proessional computer people is not wanted, they can weed
it out if the questionaire is identified.

These in addition to the other arguments for computer buffs and pros
sending the questionaire to CU.

others might not have it.  Could it be put on the net--it's short as I

I have had no difficulty printing on an Epson MX80F/T in both
upper and lower case.  Can you describe in more detail the problem
you're having with lower case characters?

As for extended character sets, Pacific Software Systems offers CPM
software to support Epson printing using multiple proportionally
spaced fonts and user definition of additional characters and fonts.
Printing is at full Epson resolution (~25000 dots/sq. in.) which is
much better than the normal Epson fonts.

At COMDEX this year a salesperson at the Corvus booth tried to
give me the usual enthusiastic but devoid of content explanation.  The
feller tried to show me the windowing software and crashed it when he
moved the cursor off the edge of the window.  Salespeople can be fun
to watch at times like that.

	The device itself is really cute though, with it's tilting
display and Apple compatible bus slots.  The display has what you
might call "lowest possible resoultion full page display" graphics.
It has functions keys on the detachable keyboard, which are labelled
on the bottom of the display, wherever it may be.  It is sometimes a
little tough to tell what key goes with which function, especially if
you put the keyboard in your lap. Probably overpriced ($5000 for
that?).  I came away suprized at how slowly it was running, which
someone later explained was because it was emulating a Z80.  One giant
step forward, many tiptoe movements backward.

to buy a site license for that package.  With a site license we
can distribute it to anyone in the Pentagon, without having to go
back and buy another copy from Condor.  We have many many copies
now running on many different machines.  Most of the micros are
Compustars and we have had no real complaints from any of the
users.  In fact, they find it very easy and quick to learn.  It
seems to be a very reliable package, and Condor is coming out with
many new features, all the time.  If you have any specific

	I would beg to differ with you Byron, as to the value of
testimony from the professional community.  A prospective new user has
no past experience as to what has been and is now available.  The
comments from one who has past experience can be quite valuable and
only misleading if the person giving the advice does not take into
consideration 'where the user is coming from'.

	To say that the very people who understand the machines best
cannot give the best advice only suggests that they cannot communicate
their information, not that they are not the best qualified to
comment.

	What is needed is for us to come down off our high horse and
provide the information, for which we are qualified to give, in a
manner which is understandable.

	To be a wizard at what we do contributes nothing to anyone,
including ourselves, if we are not able to communicate it to those new
initiates seeking help.

	The very things that bug us will bug the new user as well.
While it is true that some things will not be immediately bothersome
to the new user, he will eventually become aware of, and irritated by,
the things we see immediately upon reviewing a product.

	We can continue to allow the knowledge we have remain locked
up inside us and grin at the floundering of the new 'lusers', firing
off incomprehensible drivel made to impress, or we can take the time
to think about their plight and give reasonable help.

	This responsibility rests with all of us each time someone
trusts us with a question in our field.

MY Espon MX-80 (The one without the paper feeder) with my Apple II Plus prints
lowercase letters just dandy.  SuperScribe just loves it, even though I do

The reason we should not bestow our "expert" (term used advisedly)
opinions on personal computers is that expert opinions were not
asked for.  Simply, we know too much.  We would not send our machine
in for repair for a software problem, for example.  A novice user
would and it is a useful piece of information for CU if some ripoff
company tries to make a novice user who does so pay for hardware
repair.  In other words, let experts evaluate the questionaires

submit them....

cc: Seiler at Mit-Xx
Via:  Mit-Ai; 17 Jul 82 23:43-EDT

Consumers Union is interested in several issues regarding personal
computers that I think the "experts" are most able to answer.
Some examples are frequency of repair, quality of documentation,
capabilities (how zippy is the execution, does it have good mass
storage, etc.)  Nonexperts ("consumers"), who probably have experience
with only one type of personal computer, will do a bad job at answering
these questions, I think.  I would encourage anyone who has a
computer at home (I don't, alas) to get the questionaire and fill it
out, keeping in mind that what a consumer wants from a personal
computer is not quite the same as what most of us want.  After all,
Consumers Union solicits auto experts to judge the automobiles they
review (and audio experts for the low cost audio equipment), so
why shouldn't they have the benefit of our opinions?

Hi --

        Large-scale software development  environments  like  you
would  prefer  to  use  certainly do exist, and, to my knowledge,
they are in the public domain.  While I was going to Grad  School
at  the U of Illinois, Urbana, one of the other grad students had
designed a "universal cross-assembler" which ran  on  our  DEC-10
under  TOPS-10.  This program, written in PASCAL, would accept as
input a "universal" assembly language source file and the name of
a  processor target file and assemble the source for the particu-
lar target.  We would then download from the 10 to the target and
run  (Intel  Hex  Format object).  When I left, the program would
assemble for the 8080, Z80, 6800, 6502, TI9900,  and  a  host  of
other micros (I think 10-15 micros total).

        You may wish to contact the Dept of CS at U  of  Illinois
for details.

I am interested in purchasing a disk for my Apple II.  Looking through the

than Apple which claim to be "compatable with all Apple software".  One of
the most promising of these seems to be a model A2 by Micro-Sci.  Since this
would be my first disk, I would need to purchase their controller board along
with the drive.

Are these drives truly compatable with all Apple software?  Do they come with
an operating system of the DOS 3.3 type?  If anyone has some information, or
better yet, has used some of these "generic drives", I would greatly appreciate
some feedback.  These drives appear to be a good deal less expensive, but I

As a long-time member of Consumers Union I carefully considered whether
I should send in for a questionnaire or not.  I decided not.

The purpose (and most important function) of Consumer Reports is the
evaluation of products as consumer items.  As such, expert testimony
(the kind I assume most people on the net would give) is probably
misleading.  What they are interested in is the useability, not the
capability, of machines.  IF IBM 3081s were sold for the price of
Apples, for example, the 3081 would be downrated for its complexity
and quality of documentation in the view of CU.

As I would not buy a car on the basis of a compendium of answers
from expert mechanics or race-drivers (remember they do their own
repairs) or audio equipment on the basis of the opinions of recording
studio engineers, If I were a novice interested in personal computing
I would certainly not buy a machine based on the opinions of high-end
users -- myself included.  What I would want to know is whether or
not I could use it as a beginner and whether or not it came doing the
things I wanted it to do.

Given the state of the art in ergonometric design of most personal
computers I doubt that the testimony of many readers here would be
useful, and might be disastrously misleading to a novice.  How many
here would feel positive about the TRS-80?  Yet Tandy has done as
good a job as any in introducing consumers to personal computers in
a positive way.

    From: Steven T. Kirsch <SK at MIT-MC>

    what do you want to know?

I'm particularly interested in knowing what comments or opinions other
people who have used the various versions of the CT may have.  Things such
as:
* How radically has their software changed since it's introduction.
* Have other people been experiencing what Convergent refers to in their editor
  documentation as 'editor crashes'? 
* Have any users had problems with the file system?

* Although Convergent's documentation is fairly readable,  in my opinion,
  it has not always been representative of the products it describes.
  In particular,  Ive found that the documentation describing process and
  task management facilities does not refer to the version of the software
  that it came with,  but rather to some imiginary version lying somewhere in
  between the current version and an as yet unreleased version (7.0).  I'd
  like to know what additional areas people may have found this to be true in?
				
* Do the Borroughs and NCR systems based on the CT use the same operating
  system (CTOS)?  Or do they use XENIX (as the TRW version will, I am told)?
  Or still something else? Perhaps another OS built on top of CTOS?  
  And what experiences do have people had with these?

* Has anyone written a decent memory management facility for CTOS?  Having
  to deallocate memory in the exact reverse order of allocation regardless of
  what process you are just doesn't cut it.

* Has anyone written a replacement for the Convergent executive?  Especially
  one that spawns additional processes rather than chaining to the desired
  program?  What were the difficulties involved?  Was it possible with
  a pre- 7.0 release of CTOS?

* What opinions have you (if any) of the hardware?

* I've been experimenting with a CT workstation for a little while now,  and 
  would like to hear what other peoples opinions of it are.  My own opinions
  so far are that they have some flashy software,  what looks to be a decent
  screen management facility, some other good software,  some pretty poor
  software,  and overall a very poor integration of the the various parts
  of the system.   Particulary troublesome have been editor crashes, HUGE task
  and task file sizes,  and difficulty in obtaining customer support.  (They
  are friendly but overloaded to the point that they /never\ return phone
  calls and are almost always unavailable when called.  (have others had 
  trouble getting customer support?)  I dont feel qualified to judge the 
  hardware... does anyone have any particularly good or bad feelings in this
  area?

I'm cc'ing this to works and info-micro,  hoping to reach some others who
have experience with the CT workstation. (If you saw this in INFO-MICRO, please
reply directly, as I am not on that list. Thanks)

I am looking for software development tools for micros such as the
8086, 68000, and PDP-11/23.  The tools should run on a mini or
mainframe such as Prime, VAX, IBM, or DEC-20.

The language of choice is C; so the critical item for the development
environment is a cross compiler for C targeted for the above micros.
Other nice elements would be emulators, debuggers, and the such that
run on the development host machines as well as on the micros them
selves.

The target operating systems are DEC's POS (nee RSX-11) for the
Professional 325 and 350, MS-DOS for the IBM PC and etc., CPM-86, MPM,
and Unix on the 68000.

Such an integrated software development environment probably isn't
presently available.  But surely some of the major pieces are here
now.  (I hope.)

By the way, what are the 'big boys' doing for large scale software
development?  Surely places like Microsoft and Digital Research are
not using the crummy programming environments currently available on
the popular micros to produce major new systems, particularly when the
systems are targeted for more than one family of micro CPU and OS
combination.

Subject:  Re:  A z-80 emulator for the 8080/z80

Eliot,

        First of all, do you want an EMULATOR or a SIMULATOR?  To
me,  Emulation implies changing the microcode of one processor to
make it look like another.  The VAX 11/780, for instance,  has  a
PDP  11/70  emulation  mode, in which case the User MicroControl-
Store is programmed to recognize PDP 11/70 machine code.

        If you want a simulator, that's basically what DDT,  SID,
ZDT,  and ZSID are.  They simulate execution of machine code by a
processor and allow you to watch  what  happens  while  the  code
runs.   You can watch registers change and even examine what hap-
pens to memory between each instruction.  The EM8080 program  you
mention is what I would call a simulator.

        Note: You HAVE to have  a  microprogrammable  machine  in
order to perform emulation.  The AMD2900 bit-slice chips would be
an example.  There are several GP-machines, such  as  the  GenRad
2900  (number correct?) and the Tektronix 85xx-series.  They pro-
vide cross-software capability like what you are probably looking
for, but they are probably outside the price range you are in.  I
have not seen any public-domain simulator for a Z80 which runs on
an  8080  ...  ZDT  and  ZSID both run on a Z80 for a Z80 and are
rather complete simulations.

Subject: C on the 6502
Via:  Nbs-10; 16 Jul 82 10:01-EDT

I've ported Ron Cain's Small-C Compiler to the 6502,
(to the Atari 800 Home Computer) and I remember that the
benchmarks (like the High-Level-Language Benchmark out of the
Sept. '81 Byte) placed its speed at six times faster than Atari
Basic, or about half the speed of the Atari Pascal compiler.  The
actual time was 440 seconds, I think, which isn't very fast. (see
p. 192 of the September 1981 Byte for other times)

The big problem is the 6502 architecture, which makes it impossible
to write compilers.  My implementation is yet another pseudo-code
interpreter.  Ah well, "the amazing thing is not that it compiles
quickly, but that it compiles at all."

On a related topic, my attempt to port Ron Cain's C to the TRS-16 was
foiled by the pathalogical stupidity of the TRS-DOS16 operating
system.  For reasons known only to the innermost circle of Tandy
systems "programmers", the 68000 assembler & editor use a new and
incompatible file format, and no format conversion program exists.

A warning to people bringing Small-C up under VMS -- the current
version of the VAX VMS C compiler can't store more than 7 bits of
information in a character (not even as negative numbers), so you
have to re-code all lines using "offset".

  The only C I know of for the vanilla Apple is an interpreted one
from Tiny C associates. It's called "Tiny C one".  They also have
"Tiny C two", which is a compiled version, but like all the following,
runs under CP/M.
  If you have CP/M on you Apple, you can get:

					Holmdel, NJ  07733

	Telecon Systems C	from:	Telecon Systems

The cheapest one I know about costs 49.00 ("large subset"), and is:

	C/80			from:	The Software Toolworks
					14478 Glorietta Drive
					Sherman Oaks, CA  91423

The above compilers run on Z-80, 8080, or 8086 cards.  A couple of
the companies listed have versions for more than one processor.
  I cant vouch for any of the above, since I, like you, have been
waiting for a good 6502 based C compiler.  Is there one ?

I am looking for a good but cheap source for a floppy disk drive
for a home brew project.  I am designing my own controller so
S100-like compatability isn't important.  The prices I've seen run
around $390 for a SSDD 8" and around $500 for DSDD.  The 5" drives
seem to run $200 SSDD and $235 DSDD.  (Prices from recent BYTE mag.)

Does anyone know of a less expensive source.

Groan...  My point, condensed for the telegraphic mode of netnews, was:

It became popular to port UNIX to new machines after the people at Bell
showed that the whole slew of UNIX C code would still run on a Interdata,
once the kernel was moved.  This is because most application code was
written in C, and performed non-trivial interactions with the kernel
through system calls (i.e. just porting a C compiler to another system
doesn't usually give you the virtual OS support that most programs assume.)
There's so much good stuff in the UNIX package, that the effort involved
to port it to another machine makes it all worth-while.  (Not to mention
how nice UNIX is even without all the extra software!)

NOW, most CP/M software can be split into three categories:

	8080/Z80 assembler code	(largest group)
	CBASIC or Microsoft BASIC programs (a bit smaller)
	all the rest (C, PASCAL, whatever, it's not a lot)

All the assembler stuff has to be rewritten. Period.
The BASIC stuff mostly never cared that it ran under CP/M.
PLUS that BASIC interpreter (written in assembler!) has to be rewritten.
Some high-level stuff interacted with CP/M thru "bios()" calls,
but it's such a small amount that it's hardly worthwhile.

My point is that you don't gain anywhere near the same treasure-
trove of software when you port CP/M to another machine architecture.
All you really give the user is an identical user interface, and
one that isn't so hot.  If you really wanted, you could put a CP/M
like shell on top of a more modern 68000 operating system, and you'd
have gained 95% of all the advantages of a complete port.

Can anybody explain why interupts are so ignored in cp/m-type systems? 
Here at the Labs, I have often had to explain to people that MOST cpm
systems do not have interupts, that i/o is done by polling.  I have an
idea why this is this way -- in the "early days" (when the Altair first
came out) most people ran Altair BASIC [pre-Microsoft BASIC].  This
BASIC was ORG'ed at zero, so the restart locations weren't available. 
The BASIC was also operating system independent -- there was NO operting
system as there is now with cpm, so the BASIC did all the i/o console,
and cassette tape (did it do the disk too?).  In anycase, since it did
polled i/o, that seemed to set the stage for the rest of the "world". 

	Anybody else have any ideas?

The only reason to port CP/M would be for the large software base which one
could draw on. The 68000 is not 8080 compatible. I'm sure that you could write
a program to convert 8080 code to the 68000, but I wonder if people will really
want to do that.

Yesterday I sent out a message referring people to an article on 432
performance.  I have since received a few messages requesting that I
summarize the data.

I contacted David Patterson at Berkeley and he said that he had no
problems with me doing that.

The experiment tested the 432, 8086, 68000, and VAX 11/780 for four
integer and character programs written in Ada, C, and Pascal.  The
tests were:
	string search - Search a 120 char string for a 15 char substring.
	seive - prime number seive
	puzzle - a bin packing program
	acker - Ackermann(3,6); more than 170,000 procedure calls.

432	4 MHz release 2 system.  Software written in Ada

8086	5 MHz. Pascal compiler.

68000	1) Dual Systems 8 MHz 68000 on S-100 bus.  MIT C compiler.
	2) Exormacs 8 MHz 68000.  Motorola Pascal compiler.
	3) Motorola supplied 16 MHz 68000 running with no wait states.

VAX	1) VMS Pascal compiler.
	2) Unix C compiler.
	3) Berkeley Unix Pascal compiler.

The timings were quite well done and the tables are revealing.
A very rough summary:

4 MHz 432 = .05 VAX
5 MHz 8086 = .4 VAX
8 MHz 68000 = .6 VAX
16 MHz 68000 = 1.75 VAX

Now the summary that David Patterson likes to give verbally is that
a Release 2 432 is about 1/5 of a 5 MHz 8086.

    I haven't seen any discussion in this list about DEC's new personal
computers, so I thought I'd describe some.  Please excuse me if this
material has already been covered.

    Last May, DEC announced four personal computer products.  The 
Rainbow 100 is a CP/M machine.  The DECmate II is a word processor.
The Professional 325 and 350 are, well, I guess I'd call them personal 
workstations.  I assume the Professional 325 and 350 are of most interest
to this list, so I will only describe them here.  The 350 has the highest
price of the four.  I will send a description of the Rainbow 100 to Info-CPM.


    Here is a summary of the major features of the Professional 325 and 350.
Everything mentioned below comes in the standard configuration.  The only
differences between the two machines lie in the options they can have.

Processor:
    Contains a 16 bit processor based on the PDP-11/23B.
Operating System:
    Based on RSX-11M-Plus, with a menu interface layered on top.  Supports 
    multi-tasking, task protection, and memory management.
Mass Storage:
    5 1/4" dual disk drive with 400Kbytes (formatted) per disk.
Memory:
    256Kbytes RAM.
Monitor:
    12" screen.  Selectable 80x24 or 132x24 characters displayed.
Graphics:
    1024x256x1 bitmap graphics memory (960x240 pixels visible on screen).
Keyboard:
    Super thin "ergonomic" keyboard with VT100-type keypad, arrow keys,
    and 18 special function keys (8 user-definable).
Packaging:
    Separate monitor, keyboard and system box (latter houses floppy drive).
Communications:
    Printer port and RS232C port on system box.
    Two modular telephone plugs on system box (see options).


    There are also a number of options available, including the below:

Floating point adaptor.
5Mbyte 5 1/4" Winchester disk (fits in system box - Professional 350 ONLY).
Board with integral modem and voice to digital and digital to voice 
    converters (requires the Winchester disk option).
Extended bitmap graphics (to a total of three bits per pixel) with color map.
Color monitor.
Dot matrix printer that can reproduce screen graphics.
VT100 emulation software.
Ethernet interface board planned (not yet designed).
A bunch of software is currently being written (see below).


    Now for the bottom line.  The Professional 350 is priced at $5000.
The Professional 325 (which can't have a Winchester disk) is priced at
$4000 (the 325 has fewer option board slots and a smaller system box
than the 350).  The Winchester disk option costs $3500.  All of this
stuff will be marketed through ComputerLand, Hamilton/Avnet, and directly
from Digital Equipment Corp.  Volume manufacturing starts in October,
so you can't buy one yet, but the ComputerLand stores are supposed to
have demo machines fairly soon.  Some 22 software houses have signed
agreements with Digital to produce software for the Professionals.
If you want more information, ask me, or else call 1-800-DIGITAL.

immediately afterward). I realize that virtually every electronics
equipment company that makes video equipment is now making color
monitors, but I'm interested in people's experiences with particular 
brands. What has proven to be reliable or unreliable? How about
stability of convergence and other adjustments? Is it possible to get
good enough resolution with a composite video monitor, or will we need
to buy RGBs? I'd appreciate hearing about anybody's experiences in this
area. Please respond to me, and I'll summarize for the net if I get 
enough of interest.

While I'm on that subject, I'd like to make a plea. Lots of juicy 
questions get asked on this and the other microcomputer bboards, with
responses going to the sender rather than the bboard. This keeps the
bboards from filling up weekly, but it also leaves us who read the
bboards with a distinct lack of information. If people make inquiries
that might be interesting to people other than themselves, could we

more frustrating than seeing somebody ask about something you yourself

Via:  Usc-Ecl; 14 Jul 82 2:10-EDT

I just had an installation and service call on my new TRS-80 Mod 16.
It turns out that it runs memory-mapped video programs like
wordstar, vedit, etc just fine as configured for Pickles and
Trout CP/M for the Model II.  The problem was a defective Z-80
board in the Model 16, and rumor has it that a few of the early
production Model 16's all had the same defect, allegedly caused
by a couple of bad jumpers.  The problem only shows up when you
try to access the screen via Pickles and Trout calls.

I spoke to Greg Pickles today and he tells me that they are ready
to release their cp/m for the Mod 16 in Mod II mode, now.  It
will support both sides of the Tandon drive(s).  They are only
waiting for the documentation to be xeroxed.

BTW-There is an outfit in Oregon advertising a converter program
to get TRSDOS Model II Visicalc running under P&T cp/m and also TRSDOS
basic (a little different than Microsoft cp/m MBASIC) running under
P&T cp/m.  They both work fine; I bought them.  They also have a backup
and a disk format utility that copy Pickles and Trout cp/m disks, 
including all system tracks from any disk to a blank one.  That saves
a lot of time when using a modified cp/m, as, for example ZCPR modified
CCP.  The backup is also very fast (45 sec for a full copy) since
it goes straight to the disk ports, avoiding cp/m.

I received an article preprint from David Patterson at Berkeley concerning
performance of the 432.  It was supposed to appear in Computer Architecture
News, vol. 10, no. 4, June 1982, pp. 17-26.  I assume that it was indeed
published.

The tests they ran compared VAX, 68000, 8086, and 432.  I suggest that you
take a look at this.  The numbers they came up with are quite interesting.

I'm sure you will die when I suggest this, but here goes.

If you need a compiler for your Apple because you need the performance,
I suggest that you get a compiler for Applesoft BASIC.  As far as I'm
concerned, the best one is TASC, from Microsoft.  It generates excellent,
compact code, provides some nice extensions to the language (like true
integer arithmetic), and is almost completely compatible with the interpreter.
Programs can be developed and debugged under the interpreter and then
compiled for performance.  Most large Applesoft programs tend to run 4-6
times as fast. Programs taking advantage of integer arithmetic run even
faster.  The combination makes effective use of the advantages of both
interpretation and compilation.  That tends to make up for some of the
inadequacies of the language.

C and Pascal are certainly more effective programming languages than BASIC.
However, because of the architecture of the 6502, I doubt that you will be able to
get much better performance out of a C compiler than you will from TASC.

	I will shortly be in the market for an S-100 floppy disk controller
and would appreciate any netters' opinions on what may be a good one to buy.
The main features I'm looking for are:

		Must be able to work the S-100 as used by the North Star
		Horizon (this is actually fairly standard),

		Ability to handle both mini and standard floppies,
		preferably simultaneously,

		Ability to transfer data using DMA (or at least not be
		too fussy about how long it takes the processor to read
		the data once it becomes available),

		Ability to interrupt the processor when something happens
		in the disk system (data ready, drive online, etc.)

	I don't mind doing a bit of building so if a bare board or kit is
available, so much the better. The only one I've seen so far that satisfies
these reqiurements is the Godbout Disk 1 at about $450. Anyone know of anything
cheaper? Anyone had any experience with this controller?

	If anyone else is interested, I'll forward/summarise replies.

Absurd is a very strong word.  It seems a bit silly to perpetuate
an outmoded RT-11 like user interface.  For all those applications
written in BASIC, I would say that it makes more sense to write
a 68000 BASIC that is compatible with the popular CBASIC and MBASIC
interpreters and put it on top of a decent OS.  Don't confuse most
BASIC applications (which really know nothing nor care anything about
CP/M) with CP/M itself.

Thanks to all who responded to my query about wire wrap tools.
Here is a summary of the results:

There was about a 50/50 split between those who loved the Slit'n'Wrap
tools and those who tried it and gave up.  Apparently, once you get the
hang of it, it can do daisy chaining and regular connections quite easily;
BUT many folks reported problems that appeared later (sometimes
after a year or so).  It seems that the special SnW wire can decompose,
especially around corners, and generate occasional shorts.  Others had
problems with connections on large boards.

It seems like you get what you pay for and using good wire and a good
tool (e.g., Gardner Denver or such) is the best route to follow.  For
myself, I found that while I was waiting for the responses to roll in, I
slowly wrapped my 32K memory board using the you-twist-it type tool (grunt,
but after a while you really get quite good at it).

PS: There was one other response about the Just Wrap tool.  Apparently
there were problems with the tool not slitting the wire.

To provide a reference for uiucdes!richards first crude timings
of the 432, I ran similar runs on a pdp11/70.  Programs were main
routines written in C, and timings obtained from UNIX (tm)
per process accounting.

Statement (repeated 1,000,000 times)  CPU time     Statement Time
 
null                                     7.0 sec       ---------

z = x + y (All 32 bit integers)         15.1 sec        8.1 us
z = x * y         "                     58.2           51.2
z = x / y         "                   1:56            109.

z = x + y (All 32 bit floating point)   19.9 sec       12.9 us
z = x * y         "                     21.6           14.6
z = x / y         "                     26.7           19.7

z = x + y (All 16 bit integers)         11.1 sec        4.1 us
z = x * y        "                      15.1            8.1
z = x / y        "                      19.4           12.4

Sorry that soo much data is provided, but simply comparing a
32 bit machine performing 32 bit arithmetic with a 16 bit machine
performing 32 bit arithmetic can be misleading.

An important difference between richards data and the above is the
time required to execute the null statement; i.e., the loop code.
That is a measure of the ADA compiler as well as a measure of the
machine.

I have used the Franklin Ace extensively and found it to be a
fantastic machine! It's keyboard is well designed, having RESET
up in the corner, as a button, not a key. The keyboard has Upper and
lower case with a lock key, and has a numeric keypad. It also comes
with a fan built in, and a 16k ram card. It acts exactly like an
Apple except for a few things:
1) It does not have color graphics, just black and white, but it 
   appears that the mother board is capable of handling color simply
   because it has labels for some components, but they aren't there,
   and can be easily installed.
2) It doesn't have cassette I/O, but again, it labeled, but the
   components aren't there (and you have to drill 2 holes)
3) It comes with Applesoft, but it has provisions for on-board
   Integer. All you have to do is get some sockets, a switch, a
   resitor, and the Integer roms, and you've got both on the
   motherboard.

All in all, it works well and is slightly better than an Apple, 
especially if you only plan on using a B/W monitor, cause you'll
never know the difference.

I don't wish to engage in a debate on the value of implementing CP/M

most if not all CP/M application software is written in 8080/Z80 assem-

one dilect of BASIC or another, with C becoming more popular all the

I may agree 100% that CP/M on an M68000 is not the way to go
(I'm not sure I do, but that's not the point), however, my
objection was to the narrow argument that it is NOT because
of the preponderance of assembler language software.  There
may be 1000 good reasons not to implement a new flavor CP/M
on the M68000, but that's not one of them.

So far, I've discovered that these chips do not like to have their
recv buffer read while the xmit buffer is still draining.  The fix to
that one is simple (if your chip exhibits this problem of garbled
input - not all do): just check both bits (03H) when checking input
status.

That's all well and good.  Now for the strange part: when using a
program like MODEM to send out a file, the last byte of the block,
which normally should be the checksum byte, is the NAK received up
front to kick off the process!  Looks like the xmit drain problem in
reverse, doesn't it?  Again, not all of the chips have this problem -
and the problem doesn't appear to be run specific either.

Last I heard (rumor), Signetics has withdrawn the 2661.  I have not
heard about the 2651.  The 2651 is used in the Thomas Engineering
QLC-100, four-port card.  The 2661 is used in the Action DPC-180 and
DPC-100 cards.

If anyone uses either of these chips and has run across the second
problem, and discovered a solution, I would like to hear about it

I believe that the timing is correct.  Some of the overhead may be caused by
the iMAX operating system.  When you return from a context, all the objects
owned by that context are freed up. It may be that upon return, the iMAX
object/memory garbage collector is jumping in at a higher priority and
reclaiming/compacting the "normal" memory group for me.

Anyone else have ideas other than "it's just overhead of Call_With_Message"?

I have an H-8 with 128K of memory, a Z80A, an S-100 disk controller,
and some other goodies.  It runs CP/M on normal, 8" floppies (Shugart
851's).  D-G Electronic Developments Co., 1827 S. Armstrong St.,
Garland, TX. 75020, supplied the CPU, replacement front-panel EPROM,
and the dynamic RAM.  Their prices were quite reasonable, as were their
designs, enabling the old H-8 to use the Z80A and all 64K of address
space at 4Mhz.  The disk controller is an S-100 type, a Jade Double D
purchased from Jade Computer Products in California for $60 for the
bare board.  It has an on-board Z80A and uses a WD 179X FDC chip.  I
made an adapter card to create an S-100 bus slot for the H-8.  This
required only two bus buffers and five other IC's, plus a slight mod
to the memory cards to handle the S-100 PHANTOM* signal.  Since the
Jade controller does not use DMA, no fancy interfacing was necessary.
With the above configuration plus a Heath 4-port serial card, the old
H-8 is a reasonable CP/M machine.  But don't count on Heath (or anyone
else's) support for too long:  the H-8 is dead!

Subroutine calls are indeed slow! -- This is what I got on the first test...

100,000 calls to a no-argument subroutine took 1:09.0 - the loop overhead
counts for 0:06.0 of that (see previous note), so we are talking of about
603 microseconds per call??? I'll look at the call instruction to see exactly
what it does, and what the return instruction (the only code generated for
a null body subroutine)....

A first set of (crude) timing data has been obtained on our iAPX432
development system.  These runs were a main program written in ADA, compiled
using the Unix(tm) pre-release of the 432 Cross Development System
and run on the 432/670 with release 2 GDP's:

Statement (repeated 1,000,000 times)	Elapsed Time	Statement Time

null;					1:00.00		--
v1 := v2 + v3; (All 32-bit integers)	1:21.0		21 microsec
v1 := v2 * v3;  ------- " ---------	1:29.0		29 microsec
v1 := v2 / v3;  ------- " ---------	1:38.0		38 microsec

The times were taken by hand -- the operating system kernel (iMAX432 V2) doesn't
allow access to the process clock that the 432 keeps for each process...
Code sequences for each statement was very clean (one instruction for each
non-null statement above), but the loop had *2* termination tests.
I'll post the call/return timings shortly.

I have had this HEATHKIT H8 machine for about two years now, and I've
  decided that it's time to do something with it.
Does anyone know where I can find a couple of USED floppy drives
  that are compatible with the strange heathkit 50-pin bus? I ask 
  for USED drives 'cuz my budget is tight.
I am also interested in finding a supplier of HEATHKIT H8 compatible
  boards (memory, serial interfaces, etc.) because HEATHKIT prices are
  too steep for my taste. [So why did I buy an H8 in the first place
  you ask...well, I was 'loaded' and inexperienced at the time...].
Does anyone have any idea of the amount of messing around one has
  to do to get CP/M to run on an H8 (Does the 1K panel monitor get in the
  way?).

For those of you not previously aware of it, I maintain a master list
of ARPANET mailing-lists/digests/discussion groups (currently 756
lines or ~29,000 characters) on OFFICE-3 in file:

   <ALMSA>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT

   For ARPANET users, OFFICE-3 supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS
   login within FTP, with any password.

To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, I have
established a mailing list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  I do
not propose to send copies of the list itself to the world at large,
but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend to FTP the updated
versions when updated, I will send a brief notice that a new version
is available.  For those counterparts at internet sites who maintain
or redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, etc.)
and can't reach the master by ARPANET FTP, I will send out the
complete new file.  I do \not/ intend to send file copies to
individual users, either ARPANET or internet; our system is fairly
heavily loaded, and we can't afford it.

There is no particular pattern to the update frequency of INTEREST-
GROUPS.TXT; I will occasionally receive a burst of new mailing-lists
or perhaps a single change of address for a host or mailing-list
coordinator, and then have a long period with no changes.

To get on the list, send requests to ZELLICH@OFFICE-3, \not/ to the
mailing-list this message appears in.

Cheers,
Rich

	It is becoming clear that the state of teh personal computer,
and for that matter, the small business computer, is becoming limited not
by the hardware that abounds in the field, but by the software that has,
in some glaring examples, been written by individuals or groups that
appear to have had little idea of what the market desired.  Operating systems
for microcomputers (at least the two leading ones, CP/M and Unix, and their
respective generics) have been greatly maligned, to the point where one
wonders when someone will set out to define and implement something better.

	I would like to do just that.  However, one way to avoid the problems
of the "first generation" operating systems that have prevailed in the past
is to look at the market FIRST.

What I am wondering is: how many individuals out there who use microcomputers
regularly would be willing to attend a semi-formal conference with, say, a
scheduled 20-30 hours of meeting time, with the specific intent of formulating
a specification for the next generation operating system.  The intent is to
base the system on what the conference attendees decide is the need of the
current and future market.

I am willing to organize such a conference if there is a reasonable amount
of interest in attending.  I would like to limit the attendance to less
than 5 individuals, if at all reasonable.  Probably the best way to do so
would be to limit attendance to San Francisco Bay area professionals.  (Any
thoughts on this?)

In any case, if you have any interest in this at all, send me mail, and I will
be glad to provide more details; things are currently in the idea stage only.

I got my Model 16 this week.  I am running it with Pickles and Trout
CP/M, floppy disk version, same as I used on my Model II.
So far, with a few exceptions (below), all my Mod II CP/M software
works fine.  The only minor annoyance is the Drive not ready
message whenever a Tandon drive times out and is then accessed.
However, the drive then starts up automatically and the
machine continues, without any need to hit return.

Of course, I cannot access the second side of each drive yet.
I spoke to Pickles and Trout (well, Pickles), and they have 
their 16 as well.  They will support it soon.  The support
will correct the time-out message and will handle both sides
of the Tandon drives.  That will be Z80-based.  68000 support
has to wait for Digital Research to come up with CP/M for
the 68000.  Meanwhile keep your eye out for anything
else for the 68000.

The exceptions.  Two programs that use the memory mapping
for video display on the Mod II need modifications.
They are Wordstar and Vedit.  The way to get Wordstar running
is to reinstall it and insert the Pickles and Trout screen
codes by hand, as indicated in the Wordstar manual.  Do not
use the Mod II with P&T option in the Wordstar install program.
Then it works fine.  As for Vedit, it comes with two files for
installation on the Mod II; one is for P&T and the second is
for everyone else's CP/M.  If you install it on the Mod 16
using the second (filename ends in 'g') not the first
(filename ends in 'p') it also works fine on the Mod 16.

Let me know what you discover as you go along.

I remember seeing adds for a thing called "Anix" in some micro-computer

really another operating system, or just a software tools type item.

Alternatively, you could buy one of the 6809 boards (The Mill?), and

     ME,  or some other engineering or related field, but has had
     very little contact with computers.)

     1. A powerful command language ( a la Unix )

     2. menu driven application - usually single letter or single
        word responses required.

     3. menu driven - menu consisting of graphics characters

     4. menu driven, but allowing pointing to  an  entry  by  the

     5. Some other method (please explain)

If you  have  direct  answers  or  some  pointers  to  literature
(preferably  making  definite recommendations), please respond by

Re:   Disk drives, and expansion boxes (Medium length message)

Greetings.

	I would like to install a disk drive into my H88.  I would
rather install the Soft-sectored double density floppy controller and
the single sided floppy drive.  My Heathkit friend insists that I have
to first install the hard-sectored single-density controller.  (Note,
these are to be installed, so that my H88 becomes a H89)  I am
currently using their cassette operating system, which bytes (groan).
I am thinking of switching to disk, but would like to get the most
memory for my money.

	Also, I would appreciate any remarks about CP/M, HDOS, CP/NET,
and TurboDOS.  At the moment TurboDOS seems to be the best bet.

	One more thing: While reading my Byte, I came across this ad:


			H89/Z89 USER

		The M89 is an I/O expansion box
		for the H89/Z89 computer, please
		call or write us for more details.



		<photo of H89 and card cage(?)>


			MicroFlash Co.
			4916 B Carol St.
			Skokie, Ill.  60077
			(312) 677-4928


Has anyone heard of such a thing, or anything about it?  Sounds good,
especially since the H89 has *so* little room for expansion.  If
anyone knows anything about the above 3 questions, PLEASE reply.  Your
comments are *MOST* welcome.  


Thanks in advance,

Has anyone managed to get any TECHNICAL information on the new Model 16
(with the MC68000 in addition to the Z80).  Radio Shack, both locally and
Fort Worth, is no real help.  The only new user info that comes with it
doesn't even seem to cover how to get back and forth between processors
except for a TRSDOS program which loads the MC68000.  

Fort Worth say they WILL have a technical manual (the one they finally
got out on the Model II was not too bad), but it may be a year away.
I got a service tech. at a local store to admit that it had come with
a couple of sheets of hand drawn info, mostly on how to replace a board
when and if they ever get spares.  Apparently the service people dont
even have a schematic.  I am beginning to believe that RS didn't do the
board themselves, and that it was farmed out.  I wonder to whom?

I think that MicroSoft is porting XENIX, which is a UNIX lookalike to a
wide variety of machines, the 8086 included.

As far as the code produced by the C compiler -- for the 68000, the compiler
that we have (the one from MIT), produces very reasonable code. It's fast

Regarding presby!aron's request for information on an inexpensive computer
system, I have a recommendation if you don't mind doing the integration
yourself.

Try a CAL-TEX (San Jose, CA:  408/942-1424) "Big Board" (The new version with
64K, CRT controller, disk controller, serial and parallel I/O, DMA --
$895 assembled and tested).  This requires a power supply, monitor, keyboard,
and floppy disk drives which can be obtained at competitive prices
anywhere.

I have put together a "big board" system (using an interim Big Board I until
the new Big Board II arrives later this month), 2 floppies (8") and 
a terminal "shell" (monitor, keyboard, power supply (which also powers the
cpu board) in a nice enclosure) for about $2,000.  Admitedly, there were
some bargans obtained (like the terminal shell, and one of the floppy
drives) locally, but I don't think that this figure is unrealistic.

The system as described was easy to integrate.  That consisted of just
cabling together -- all the individual components were already assembled.

I have seen supposed look-alike unix for the Apple in Nibble magazine.
The advertisement described a version of unix which is upward
 the term should
be downward compatible).  The company which puts this questionable product
out is Lazer Systems (producers of the Paymar lowercase chip); the program
is called Anix 1.0.

Thanks to everyone who supplied me with information about C implementations
for the Apple.  I'm still getting responses to my request, but now seems like
as good a time as any to summarize what information I've gotten so far.  If
I hear anything else important I'll pass it along.

Several people mentioned that C is no problem for Apple II's that have
CP/M cards.  A message specifying suppliers and prices for CP/M C's has
already been posted to net.micro, so I won't duplicate that information.

Others said that C was impossible (or nearly impossible) to implement on
a vanilla Apple because of the 6502's absurdly small 256 byte hardware stack.
(Nearly all C compilers are implemented as stack machines).  This sounds
like compelling logic but, fortunately, is not strictly true.

***************
Enter Manx Software Systems.  Manx has now, in beta (soon to be final)
release, a C compiler (full K & R) that runs in standard Apple DOS.
Price: $199.  The catch: right now, the compiler generates pseudo-code that
can be linked with assembly language routines but that must be run with
an interpreter (supplied with the compiler, as is an editor and a few
shell utilities).  This is a drag for two reasons:  (1)  Obviously, slow
performance (no benchmarks given) and (2) if you want to sell something
developed in C the consumer will need the interpreter.  Manx hasn't set a
policy on how to distribute the interpreter, but will either charge
a licensing fee of ~10 for each copy sold, or have no license fee at all.

Recognizing that this arrangement is just half a loaf, Manx intends to
come out with a fully-compatible native code compiler in about 6 months
(evidently it hasn't been finished yet).  They've figured out the stack
problem (they create their own pseudo-stack, I think) and have run impressive
sounding benchmarks on the native code compiler.  All in all, Manx offers
a good potential product, but we'll have to see.

Their address:  Manx Software Systems, PO Box 55, Shrewsbury, NJ 07701.
Phone:  (201) 780-4004

Other options:

Tiny C associates (P.O. Box 269, Homodel, NJ 07733, phone (201) 671-2296)
offers a Tiny C for the Apple II for $100.  Problems:  (1) Tiny C is limited
(no for statements, no floating point math, to name two big problems).
(2) The Apple II version is, like Manx's an interpreter, and the woman at
Tiny C mentioned no plans to write an Apple II Tiny C native code compiler (al-
hough they do have one for CP/M).  This arrangement seems clearly inferior to
Manx's, except for those who want to save $99 and don't mind losing some
non-trivial language constructs and features.

Advanced Digital (1701 21st Avenue S, Nashville, TN 37212, phone 615-383-7520)
offers a C cross-compiler for the 6502 that, according to my source, can
run on UNIX, RT, RSX, IAS, VMS, etc (as long as you have the corresponding
machine's native C compiler as well).  This compiler supports almost full
C (no floats, longs, or bit fields).  The drawback:  It costs $1700.  Caveat:
I haven't followed this up, as I have no interest in a cross-compiler,
so I can't vouch for the accuracy of this information.

That's about it, except that the man from Manx (sounds like a spy novel)
said that he thought there was another full or almost full C compiler
on the market for the Apple II.  Not surprisingly, he didn't give me any
information.
***********

There you have it.  If anybody goes out and buys any of this stuff, please
send me your impressions of the product.  Thanks again to everybody who
responded.

How long does it usually take for a ZX81 to arrive after it has been
ordered?  A friend who ordered one is getting impatient.

Re: time it takes to deliver a ZX81:

    They promise shipment within 2 weeks, and that seems to be exactly
how long they take to send them.  I sent them an order on a Thursday and
got the shipment about 2 and 1/2 weeks later.

We have a VIC-20 and are very pleased with it.  We got the basic unit for
about $240 at Circle-Video (a discount, cash only shop), and the tape unit
at Toys-R-Us for $63.  Both work exactly as advertised.  All 5 of my kids,
ages 9 - 12, play the games by the hour, and write little programs as
variations on the ones in the book.  They particularly like the sound effects
and graphic figures with motion.  My oldest wrote an original simple program
the night before a science fair (2 days after we got the VIC), and won a
prize.  We had previously built a ZX-81 kit (it didn't work), and went
through months of hassle with Sinclair to try to get a 16K memory (we never
did get one that worked).  The added features of the VIC-20 are well worth
the added price, particularly the keyboard.  The VIC has 5K memory inside,
and this has been adequate for all the programs we have tried.  I can't think
of a thing to say bad about the VIC.       Mel Haas   ,   houxm!mel
