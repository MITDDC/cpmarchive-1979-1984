	A few of the additional features found in FORTRAN 77
can be supported in most 8080 FORTRANs.  The CHARACTER to
INTEGER conversions are performed for lengths of 1 and 2 only
by the RATFOR INCLUDE file F77DEF, which also provides type
descriptors for the functions on F77LIB which require them.
There is also an INCLUDE file CONSTS which automatically
defines some frequently used constants.
	Most of the new standard ("intrinsic") FORTRAN
functions can be employed by searching the file F77LIB.REL
which will be created by compiling F77LIB.FOR.  The useful
INDEX function cannot be implemented except by introducing
a third argument which is the length in characters of the
string to be found. Preferably, the length of the longer string
should be passed also.   Additional arguments are required on
most large systems which do not meet the standard.
