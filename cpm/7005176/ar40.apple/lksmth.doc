Some APPLE disk drives have exhibited problems with the head seek algorithm.
To determine if your APPLE is affected by this problem, perform the following
test:

1) Attempt to copy your LOCKSMITH disk, Track 9 only (no sync).
2) The copy may fail, but should indicate a track start (in the second line
   of the 3 line inverse block) of - D5 AD FF.
3) If this is not the case, your drives exhibit the problem, and you should
   apply patch LSGP after booting LOCKSMITH.

If your drives exhibit this problem, send your 4.0 version in for a free
revision to version 4.1 that solves this problem.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PATCHES listed below should be entered before starting copy routines unless
otherwise indicated. These patches work only for version 4.0. They are built
into version 4.1. Entering them into 4.1 will result in an 'incorrect patch'
error.

PATCH NAME - ENTER AS LISTED BELOW
PATCH MULT - MULTNQNQG/RP This patch, when applied first, allows multiple

LOCKSMITH TECHNICAL NOTES
--------- --------- -----

(based on most frequently asked questions)

We are maintaining an extensive and detailed list of disks which LOCKSMITH
will copy, as well as any parameter changes or patches which the user must
make to copy certain disks.

We are working hard to provide users with necessary parm changes as we
determine them. We openly solicit user input regarding LOCKSMITH parameters
which work for certain disks.

If, after you make the recommended parameter changes and you are still unable
to copy the disk in question, follow these instructions:

  1. Make sure your disk drive speed is correct.
  2. Retry the copy reversing the order of the disk drives used.
  3. If possible, attempt the copy on a different apple or set of drives
     to make sure that the problem is not your disk drives.
  4. If all fails, write us about the problem including all
     pertinent information about what attempts you made to copy the disk.
     If we are able to solve your problem, we will contact you.

Some protected disks use a technique known as nibble counting. This technique
is based on the fact that all APPLE disk drives run at slightly different
speeds, and even the speed of a specific disk drive varies slightly over
time. Disks which are protected by this method count the nibbles on a given
track and record this unique number somewhere else on the disk. When the
disk is booted by the user, the nibble count on the track in question is
checked against the correct value. Simply copying the track will almost
always write a different number of nibbles due to disk drive speed variation.

LOCKSMITH 4.1 has a provision for nibble counting, and will preserve nibble
counts on any track requested. To request nibble count preservation, set
parm 36 to 01. (This is automatically done for the user when parm 4C is set
to 1B.) After the track is written to the copy disk, the nibbles are counted
and compared to the original count to be preserved. The difference is shown
as a four-digit hex number preceeded by '<' or '>' to indicate to the user
which way to manually adjust the count. The count may be adjusted in one
of two ways. Either the disk speed adjustment pot can be turned in the
direction indicated by the '<' or '>' arrows (see user manual regarding
disk speed adjustment), or a limited amount of adjustment can be done from
software without actually adjusting the disk speed.

To adjust the nibble count from software, press either '<' or '>' as
indicated, and wait until the speaker begins beeping. The speaker will beep
rapidly once for each nibble that the track is being shortened or lengthened.
Then press the return key (or any key other than '<' and '>') and allow the
nibble count routine to test the track again. When the nibble count is within
the tolerance value specified by PARM 37 (normally 00), the track yill be
considered copied correctly. This technique may seem cumbersome, but it is
the only way in which a track may be copied while preserving the nibble count.

Note that nibble count adjustment from software (using '<' and '>') will not
work if a typeahead buffer is installed on the APPLE. To perform nibble count
preservation, either remove the typeahead buffer, or adjust the disk speed
pot directly.

When the nibble-editor is entered from the main menu, the track is read into
the buffer with no LOCKSMITH analysis whatsoever. No nibbles will be indicated
as self-sync (inverse), as this is determine when analysis occurs during a
disk copy operation. Also, ctrl-B and ctrl-E will place the cursor at the
beginning and end of the buffer, because track-start and track-end are also
determined by analysis during disk copy.

To enter the nibble-editor after analysis by LOCKSMITH, perform a copy
operation, specifying manual error retry. Open the door of the copy disk
drive to cause a verify error (error code 8) and enter the nibble editor by
selecting: 5. Nibble-Edit Current Track Data. In this way you may nibble-edit
a track after LOCKSMITH has performed analysis on it.

                   THE COMPLEAT GUIDE TO LOCKSMITH PARAMETERS
                   ------------------------------------------

This document describes all user-changeable LOCKSMITH parameters in depth.
A partial list of these parameters was previously distributed to all Version
4.0/4.1 owners.  Also provided here is detailed LOCKSMITH program logic
information.  Note---This document is of a highly technical nature, and is
intended primarily for the ADVANCED user of LOCKSMITH.


BACKGROUND
----------

When LOCKSMITH was first introduced in January 1981, it would copy almost all
disks with no special instructions from the user.  Only a few disks required
parameter changes.

Alas, those good old days are gone forever.  Instead of providing the user
with better backup policy, software vendors decided to escalate the battle by
developing more complicated (and in some cases, bizarre) protection
techniques.  Because of the m any different techniques now in use, it is
likely that many disks will require some input from the user in the form of
parameter changes.  Omega Microware currently maintains an extensive list of
software, along with the LOCKSMITH parameters used to copy each.  Some of the
entries on this list are user-supplied, and Omega Microware welcomes
information from users regarding how to back-up software not already on this
list.


OVERVIEW
--------

LOCKSMITH copies disks by reading a track, performing analysis on the data,
and writing the track back to the copy disk.  Reading and writing are fairly
straightforward functions.  The analysis of the track data is by far the most
difficult task, and must provide for flexibility.  Many analysis routines
(algorithms) are provided within LOCKSMITH.  Each algorithm performs a
specific function relating to the analysis of track data.  By changing
parameters, the user may select, disable, or change the execution order of
individual algorithms.


ALGORITHMS
----------

The algorithms are numbered from 0 to $23 (all values are in hex), although
more algorithms may be added in future versions of LOCKSMITH.  During track
analysis, algorithms are selected sequentially from a table of algorithm
numbers, located from PARM4C-80.  As algorithms are selected from this table
during analysis, they are displayed on the screen as 2-digit hex numbers in
inverse video.  Algorithm 00 indicates a null algorithm, which can be used to
replace algorithm numbers in the table which the user wants to disable.  An FF
entry in this table indicates the end of the algorithms to perform.

Currently, the algorithm table contains four separate algorithm sequences,
each one terminated by an FF entry.  The starting point of the algorithm
sequence to be used is defined by PARM25.  This parameter contains the index
into the algorithm table to be used as the first algorithm of a sequence.  For
example, if PARM25=00, the algorithm sequence would start at PARM4C.  If
PARM25=10, the algorithm sequence would start at PARM5C.

The section of algorithm table starting at PARM71 is selected as an algorithm
sequence start (instead of PARM4C) when synchronized tracks are chosen.

Algorithms, in addition to performing their specialized function, can return a
flag to indicate success or failure.  It is possible to indicate that an
algorithm is to be performed only if the previous algorithm failed.  This may
be done by setting the high-order bit of the algorithm number within the
algorithm table.  For example, an entry of A1 indicates that algorithm 21 is
to be performed only if the previous algorithm failed.


DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHMS
-------------------------

The following is a list of algorithm numbers and the parameters which affect
them.

ALG 00 (this algorithm doesn't do much of anything)

ALG 01 (consecutive nibbles to self-sync) changes normal nibbles to self-sync
nibbles based on:  finding (PARM10) consecutive nibbles in the range (PARM34)
to (PARM35), inclusive.  For example, if PARM10=0C, PARM34=FE, and PARM35=FF,
then algorithm 01 wou ld search for sequences of length 0C nibbles with values
FE through FF, and set them to self-sync.

ALG 02 (invalids to self-sync) sets invalid nibbles (those with 3 or more
consecutive zero bits) to self-sync.

ALG 03 (standardize self-sync) sets all self-sync to (PARM33), which must have
high-order bit clear.

ALG 04 (loner self-sync to normal) set consecutive self-sync strings of less
than or equal to (PARM3C) to normal.

ALG 05 (glitch remover) set consecutive normal nibbles of length less than or
equal to (PARM12) to self-sync.

ALG 06 (set self-sync by marker pattern match) searches for pattern specified
by (PARM44-4B), and sets the previous (PARM40) nibbles to self-sync.  Values
of 00 within the pattern are "don't care" and always match.

ALG 07 (extend bit shifted self-sync) extends self-sync strings backwards,
using the table at (PARM86-A5).  This table contains nibble value sequences
frequently found to be self-sync.

ALG 08 (reserved for future use)

ALG 09 (trackstart after longest gap) set trackstart to first normal after
longest string of self-sync (gap).

ALG 0A (minimum length self-sync) extend self-sync strings backwards to
minimum length of (PARM2C).

ALG 0B (set self-sync by self-sync pattern match) set self-sync based on
multiple-byte pattern match.  Pattern is defined at (PARM81-85) and is
terminated with a 00 value.

ALG 0C (shorten all gaps) shorten all gaps (consecutive strings of self-sync)
by (PARM41) nibbles if the string length was greater than or equal to
(PARM16).

ALG 0D (2 of 3 gap merge) merges first and second gaps (by setting to
self-sync, nibbles between them) if 3 gaps are found within (PARM26) nibbles.
(The gaps merged are usually the gap after a data field.)

ALG 0E (trackstart after first self-sync) sets trackstart to first normal
after the first string of self-sync.

ALG 0F (shorten longest gaps) shorten the longest gap if longer than (PARM2C)
by (PARMxx) nibbles.  Repeat this procedure (PARMyy) times.

   xx=27 (or 29 if synchronized)
   yy=28 (or 2A if synchronized)

ALG 10 (reserved for future use)

ALG 11 (set failure flag) same as algorithm 00, but sets the failure flag

ALG 12 (trackstart by marker pattern match) set trackstart to the first
sequence to match pattern at (PARM44-4B) (see ALG 06)

ALG 13 (center of gaps to normal) leaving 8 self-sync at the start and at the
end of a gap, set self-sync in the center of the gap to normal.

ALG 14 (bit-translate to self-sync) using the bit table at (PARMD9-E8),
translate nibbles corresponding to a one-bit to self-sync.  Bits in the table
represent values for nibbles in the following order:  80,81,82, ...
FC,FD,FE,FF

ALG 15 (reserved for future use)

ALG 16 (reserved for future use)

ALG 17 (track-end and compare) This algorithm searches for a repeat of the
track-start beginning at (PARM1D) pages beyond the current track-start.  A
repeat of the track-start is determined by matching (PARM1E) number of
nibbles.  If the track size is greater than (PARM1B) pages, an error 2 status
code will be issued.  Once a track-end is chosen, the first two track images
are compared, nibble for nibble.  If an unequal nibble compare occurs, a
look-ahead of up to (PARM13) nibbles is performed, looking for self-sync.  If
self-sync is found, the compare failure is ignored.  If no self-sync is found
during this look-ahead, a counter is incremented for the compare-failure, and
this count is checked against (PARM14), which must not be exceeded, or an
error 4 status code is issued immediately.  The 3rd track image is then used
as a tie-breaker to determine which of the 1st or 2nd track images is correct.
The exact position in the 3rd track image is found by first finding the
approximate location in the 3rd image (by using track length), backing up
(PARM11) nibbles, and pattern-matching (PARM32) number of nibbles, while
searching through the next (PARM31) number of nibbles.  The 1st image is
corrected by the tie-breaker nibble.  This algorithm returns a success/fail
flag.

ALG 18-1F (parm modifier) These algorithms are used to dynamically modify
parms.  The table at (PARMB6-D8) consists of several sequences of parm
modifier entries.  Each parm modifier entry consists of a pair of bytes.  The
1st byte defines the parm number, and the 2nd byte define s the new parm
value.  The end of a sequence is indicated by a 00 entry for parm number, and
a new sequence begins with the next byte.  Algorithm 18 invokes the 1st
sequence of parameter modifier entries, algorithm 19 invokes the 2nd sequence,
etc.  Using these algorithms, parameters may be automatically changed and
restored during analysis.  The defaults for these algorithms are currently set
as follows:

   ALG18 sets 13-sector parms
   ALG19 sets 16-sector parms
   ALG1A sets misc. parms
   ALG1B sets nibble-counting parms

ALG 20 (goto nibble buffer address) This algorithm is used in conjunction with
the nibble editor.  This algorithm prompts the user for an address to go to,
and the nibble editor cursor is immediately placed at that location.  (see
INVOKING ALGORITHMS FROM THE NIBBLE EDITOR)

ALG 21 (set error code 1) issues an error 1 status code.  It is usually placed
in the algorithm table with the high-order bit set, to cause it to execute
only when the previous algorithm fails.

ALG 22 (backup trackstart to front of gap) moves the trackstart pointer
backwards to the beginning of the preceeding gap

ALG 23 (set trackstart to longest normal) sets trackstart to the 1st nibble of
the longest sequence of normal nibbles.


PRINTER CONTROL PARMS
---------------------

(PARM2D) specifies the printer slot, and (PARM2E) is set to 00 if LOCKSMITH is
not to generate <CR> at the end of a line, or left at 01 if <CR>'s are to be
generated.


MAXIMUM ERROR COUNT PARMS
-------------------------

(PARM01),(PARM02), and (PARM04) are used to specify the number of errors
allowed for error codes 1,2, and 4 in automatic error retry mode.  If
increments of 1/2 tracks are used, (PARM09),(PARM0A), and (PARM0C) are used
instead.


NIBBLE-COUNTING PARMS
---------------------

There are 3 parameters which are used when nibble-count preservation is
desired.  Setting (PARM36) to 01 turns on nibble-counting.  The nibble-count
tolerance value, (PARM37), specifies how close to the original disk, the copy
must be.  When nibble-counting, the track-end pointer is moved up by (PARME9)
pages before writing.


PARMS USED FOR SYNCHRONIZING
----------------------------

(PARM22) specifies the track*2 to sync to.  This is normally 00, but may be
set to any track.  (PARM1F) is the length of the nibble sequence to sync with,
and (PARMA6-B5) contain the pattern to match when attempting to sync on the
sync-track.  Values of 00 within the pattern are "don't care" and always
match.  (PARM23) and (PARM24) are values which can be used to adjust the
accuracy of the sync-track routine.  They are normally equal, and can be
adjusted by increasing the value of one with respect to the other.


PARMS USED TO CONTROL WRITING
-----------------------------

(PARM20) contains the lead-in self-sync nibble value.  (PARM2F-30) (default is
$1A00) number of these lead-in self sync nibbles are written before track data
is written, with the exception of synchronized track writing, which is
preceeded by (PARM23) lead-in self-sync nibbles.  The number of framing bits
(1 or 2) is contained in (PARM21).  This places the proper number of trailing
zero-bits after self sync.  (PARM2B) contains the number of the algorithm to
be used to shorten the track after an over-write is detected by verify
readback failure.


OTHER PARMS
-----------

(PARM38) is the number of nibbles to test during verify readback.  (PARM39),
if set non-zero, shows the hi-res screen during analysis, to provide a
graphical representation of analysis.  (PARM3A) is used during disk certify.
It specifies the maximum size of the track-end glitch.  (PARM3B), when set to
01, causes the nibble-editor to be entered for every track, before analysis.


DEBUG PARAMETER
---------------

(PARM00) is a special parameter intended for use during LOCKSMITH debugging.
When this parm is set to 11, certain debugging options are enabled.  They are:

1.  Inspector entry is allowed even with no resident RWTS.

2.  Nibble-editor is entered without prompting the user for track to read.
    This allows the previous track to be examined.

3.  Invoking algorithms from the nibble-editor.  (see next section)


INVOKING ALGORITHMS FROM NIBBLE-EDITOR
--------------------------------------

With DEBUG parm set (PARM00=11), the nibble-editor is sensitive to two
additional commands.  These are control-S and control-A.  Control-S invokes
LOCKSMITH track-analysis for the track currently in the nibble buffer.
Control-A first allows the user to change parameters by entering the parameter
modifier, and after the user has indicated the end of parameter changes with a
<CR>, it prompts the user for algorithm number.  The user-entered algorithm
number is executed immediately, and control is returned to the nibble-editor.
In this way, the user can dynamically test the effects of specific LOCKSMITH
algorithm sequences when attempting to copy unknown disks.  Algorithm 00 can
be specified if no processing is to be done.  Algorithm 20 is very useful
within the nibble editor to rapidly go to a specific address within the nibble
buffer.
