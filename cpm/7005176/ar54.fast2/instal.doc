How to install FAST.COM or SPEED.COM on your system.

If you are using any of the following disk controllers,
then the .COM files will work as they are distributed.
	Tarbell single density
	Digital Systems or Digital Microsystems (single
		density)
	Intel MDS 800 or iSBC-201

If you are using any of the following disk controllers,
then you will have to insall the appropriate patch file
named below:
	Thinkertoys Discus double density	DSCUSPAT.HEX
	Digital Systems double density		DMSPATCH.HEX

If you are using something else with a physical sector size
other than 128, you will have to be a hacker and examine
the various patch files, FAST.ASM, and the skew tables in
your SYSGEN and BDOS.  Good luck.  If you manage to get a
good speed improvement on some controller not listed above,
please send a listing of the patch to the author:

		Thank you.

If you have a single density controller other than those
listed above, then use the follwoing procedure:

You will need a stopwatch or a watch with a second hand.

Pick some operation that takes a fixed amount of time, like
PIPing a file around or assembling something.  Something that
takes about 30 to 60 seconds is good.  Execute it without
FAST, and record the execution time from when you hit return
to when you see the 'A>' again.  Now try the same thing
with FAST (see FMAN.PRN for instructions), and record the
execution time.  If it got faster (look for 20 - 30%) then
you are all set and can use FAST.COM and SPEED.COM as
supplied.

If it got slower or stayed the same, then you'll need
RSPEED.COM.  Load RSPEED and enter the number of sectors
per track (most likely 26).  Start with a skew factor of
1 and time how long it takes to read a track (the time from
when you hit return to when you get the prompt again).
Now increase the skew to 2 or 3 and time a track read
again.  Sooner or later, you should note a marked decrease in
the track read time.  The skew factor you are then using
is the fastest your controller can read an entire track.
Integrate the file SKEWnPAT.HEX into FAST.COM and SPEED.COM
where n is the skew obtained above.

How to integrate a patch file:

It's simple, all you need is  DDT.COM.
DDT FAST.COM       or for speed:  DDT SPEED.COM
IfooPAT.HEX
R
G0
SAVE 8 FASTX.COM   or for speed:  SAVE 17 SPEEDX.COM

And test the new file, it should be as fast as your
system can go.  Enjoy your trip!.
