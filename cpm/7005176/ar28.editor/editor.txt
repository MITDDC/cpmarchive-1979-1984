Frank --
  I have gotten the editor to work to some extent.  It still has bugs that I
need to track down.  The original Editor appeared in Dr Dobb's and was written
in Small C.  This is available from the BDS C user's group (both Small C and
the original Editor) for a copying fee.  The major enhancement in the version
here is that it allows you to edit files larger than the available memory by
reading and writing parts of the file similar to the CP/M ED.  If I can get the
bugs out of it I will put a file of fixes out on the Access Database.  As a
start you need to make the changes in the latest Dr. Dobbs.    -- Ken

Ken,
Thanks, I am converting it to AZTEC C and am getting some things to work. 
Still quite a ways to go, but I wondered how it SHOULD work.
I'll let you know how it turns out - Frank

Frank, You can use the editor pretty much like it is described in Dr. Dobbs
using the LOAD and SAVE commands or you can make use of the READ, WRITE and
FINISH commands to read from one file, edit and then write to an output file
retaining the original as a backup.  One of the minor bugs in the program is
that FINISH does not clear the memory buffer after it is done.  This is easily
fixed by a call to the buffer clear routine at the end of the finish function. 
Good luck and keep me informed of progress.  I may have some time to get back
on this project now so I may have some more info for you later. -Ken
