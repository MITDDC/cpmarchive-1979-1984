I've just FTP'ed a new version to  CPM;XMODEM 1  (it should be really in
AR60:CPM XMODEM SAI).

This version has send/receive for either binary or asccii files.

As far as I can see, the JSYS used are the same in TOPS20; but haven't
tried it.  If someone does, pls let me know.

Comments/suggestions welcome.
