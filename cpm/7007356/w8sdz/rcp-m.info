   (This file is meant to accompany RCPMLIST.xxx, and is    
   separate from it because it does not require frequent 
   updates.)

===============================================================

   These  are the rules and etiquette for using  RCPM  systems.  
   Please  read  this file carefully to get the most from  your 
   long  distance charges,  and to respect the privacy  of  the 
   SYSOPS who are giving generously of their time and effort to 
   provide this service.

		 General Notes and Comments
		 --------------------------

1.     The   systems listed here only carry programs that  will  
   run  under the CP/M operating system,   most of them  public 
   domain  software   distributed by CPMUG or SIG/M,   the  two 
   main  CP/M users'  groups.    Some of the programs  involved  
   (especially those in  BASIC,  PASCAL and C but also a few in 
   Z-80  or 8080 assembly language) can be converted to run  on 
   other  machines  quite  easily.       Systems  dedicated  to 
   downloading  programs  for  the  PET,   APPLE,   TRS-80  and 
   NORTHSTAR do exist,  however.  Ask experienced users in your 
   area,  or  check through  "other systems" listings on  local 
   CBBS's,  ABBS's,  FORUM-80's,  etc.   Such systems are often 
   listed in files named OTHERSYS.xxx.

2.     XMODEM  is a modification of Ward Christensen's original 
   MODEM  program  designed  to allow  the  transfer  of  files 
   between the exchange system and yours.   The exchange system 
   needs the program,  not you;  you will probably be using one 
   of   the  many  versions  of MODEM   itself:   e.g.  MODEM2, 
   MODEM221,  MODEM 926,  MODEM7,  MODEM75,  TRSMODEM, APMODEM, 
   CMODEM, MBOOT3, etc.  BSTAM and most of the other commercial 
   terminal programs will not work properly with XMODEM's S  or 
   R  file  transfer modes which use the Christensen  protocol.  
   BSTAM  is also available on many remote  systems,  to  allow 
   multiple file transfers,  but it is a licensed program (i.e. 
   NOT  public domain),  so it is only available to you if  you 
   buy it.
       Certain  programs,  such  as PLINK and some versions  of 
   MODEM, can allow files to be "captured" without the benefits 
   of handshaking or error checking.   However, if you use such 
   methods, you should bear in mind the following:
     1. Errors occurring during the transfer will go undetected 
   unless  you  catch them (no handshaking/error  checking)  by 
   visual  means,  or by transmitting 2 or more copies  of  the 
   same  file.   You  can then run COMPARE or DF  against  them 
   until you get a pair that "agree".
     2.  You may not transfer .COM files. You may, however, use 
   UNLOAD  to create .HEX files from .COM files,  and the  .HEX 
   files can be sent as in #1.,  above.   The receiving end can 
   then  run Digital Research's LOAD to recreate the .COM  file 
   from the .HEX file received.
     3.  You  may  not be able to transmit some files  if  they 
   contain certain values,  such as hex 1A, which indicates end 
   of file.

3.     Non-XMODEM  program  transfer  systems are  starting  to 
   appear:  e.g., LICC's BBS on Long Island [at (516) 561-6590; 
   110-600+  baud;  24 hrs;no callback] has a few  downloadable 
   ASCII  files but at present  these must be   captured   like 
   CBBS   messages  and then saved to disk  without any  error-
   checking protocol.  John Wood, the sysop of Santa Clara CBBS 
   [at (408) 241-1956;  110-600+ baud; 24 hrs, no callback] has  
   announced    plans  to  implement   late-night    exchanges;  
   whether   these  will  use XMODEM is not yet  clear.   Chuck 
   Forsberg's  YAM  (Yet Another Modem) program is  written  in 
   BDS-C,  and  the source is available on several  systems  in 
   RCPMLIST.

4.     Some   XMODEM  systems  also  operate  as  real  CBBS's, 
   including those operated by Dick Mead and Steve Vinokouroff.  
   Others,  like  Keith Petersen's &  CCCC's  use  a   skeletal  
   subprogram for handling messages called "MINICBBS".    Their 
   emphasis is on exchanging software,  not bulletin board type 
   information.  Most RBBS systems focus on software, but there 
   are variations.
       Note  that  you  cannot transfer a .COM file to  any  of 
   these systems;  the xmodem program will not allow  it.  Some 
   systems will automatically rename any incoming .COM files to 
   .OBJ.   In addition, some systems will not let you take .COM 
   files  from them.   Most systems will also prevent you  from 
   taking   any  files  which  the  SYSOP  does  not  want   to 
   distribute.   Many  systems  contain .OBJ files;  these  are 
   really  .COM  files which you are allowed  to  download.  By 
   calling them .OBJ, the SYSOP can prevent them from being run 
   on his system,  but still make them available to you via the 
   XMODEM program.

5.     "CBBS",  "MINICBBS",  "RBBS" (and a variant, "MINIRBBS")  
   are the user-logging/message-taking programs  used by almost 
   all  of the  systems on RCPMLIST.   You  will  need  one  of 
   them if you are interested in starting your own  RCPM/XMODEM 
   system.   CBBS & MINICBBS are assembly-language programs and 
   cost  $50.   RBBS & related programs are in MBASIC and  free 
   but not quite as good as CBBS,  and,  of course, you'll need 
   the  MicroSoft BASIC compiler to use them ($250).   Ask  the 
   sysop  of  this system for  details,  or read  RBBS-USE.DOC, 
   RBBSNSTL.DOC, or CBBSFORM.DOC.

6.     A  few CBBS' and RBBS' have software exchange  functions 
   that  require the use of a password.  Some such systems  are 
   included  in RCPMLIST.  If you wish to be given a  password, 
   you  can  usually  leave  a message  to  the  SYSOP  (System 
   Operator) on the Bulletin Board of that system.

7.     Presently,  (05/82),  many of these systems are  running 
   with  hard  disks.  Several are running  MP/M.   You  should 
   become  familiar  with  the USER command to move  around  on 
   these  large capacity disks effectively.   You  should  also 
   become familiar with the SQ and USQ programs. These compress 
   files to 50-85% of their original size. Many such "squeezed" 
   files  will be seen on these RCPM systems because  squeezing 
   files  allows  more  files to be  placed  online,  and  they 
   transfer  faster.   See  the  file  named  SQ-BRIEF.DOC,  or 
   SQUEEZER.DOC.   Squeezed  files are identified by the letter  
   Q  in  the  2nd  position  of  the  filetype;  for  example, 
   MODEM7.DQC  must be run through USQ to produce the  readable 
   MODEM7.DOC file.  Be sure you download USQ-15.OBJ and rename 
   it  at your end to USQ.COM so that you can  "unsqueeze"  the 
   files you get.

8.     All  of  the  RCPM's will accept 300  baud.   Many  will 
   accept 450 or 600 baud if you can push your "300" baud modem 
   that  fast.   You can change baud rates during a session  by 
   running NEWBAUD on the host system, resetting your rate, and 
   then  re-entering terminal mode and pressing a  few  returns 
   until the host senses what your new baud rate is.   Weekends 
   or  holidays seem to give better luck with pushing to higher 
   speeds, but the quality of your modem is the biggest factor.  
   Several systems now accept 1200 baud also.
    
9.     You  should set your modem into ORIGINATE mode,  and run 
   it  at  FULL  DUPLEX while accessing  these  and  most  host 
   systems.  The normal characteristics are: 8 bits, no parity, 
   1 stop bit, 300 baud for initial log-in.

10.    Some "300 baud" modems capable of greater than 300 baud:
   The  Racal-Vadic 3451s (and the manual MODEMPHONES) have 600 
   baud  capabilities (at ordinary 103 modem frequencies).  The 
   PMMI  (Potomac  Micro Magic Inc.) modem widely used  on  the 
   S100  RCPM's  is often run at 600 and even  710  baud.   Two 
   other brands of modem will run at 600:  the  IDS on-board S-
   100  modem and Novation's newly announced RV  3451-lookalike 
   "triple modem".  Neither are yet used by an RCPM system. The 
   other  systems  on  RCPMLIST all  run  either  D.C.Hayes  or 
   assorted brands of external modem.  They usually do not send 
   or receive faster than 300 baud.

11.    Do  not despise things that are free.   It is a  curious 
   fact  in  the  computer  world that value  bears  almost  no 
   relation to price.   Some of the best programs for  personal 
   computers are in the public domain.   They often work better 
   and  are better supported than software costing hundreds  of 
   dollars. And, in terms of documentation, commercial programs 
   do not even come close.  

12.    And  please,  most of these systems operate from private 
   home telephones...    be courteous and call only during  the 
   posted  operating hours.   Note that system operating  times 
   are posted in LOCAL time, not necessarily in your time zone.  
   Be  sure to translate these times to your own before  trying 
   to call a remote system.

       NOTE:  If  the system says a "call back" is needed,  you 
   must call the number,  let the phone ring EXACTLY once only, 
   hang  up and redial.   On your second call,  the modem  will 
   answer  on the first to third ring.   If you get  no  answer 
   after 3 rings, hang up and try again later.
       The  purpose of all this is that the "call back" systems 
   are  using telephones that are also used for personal  voice 
   matters.   Be sure to respect the generosity and the request 
   of the SYSOPS.

13.    Many  systems have time limits (usually 1 hour in  prime 
   time).   You  can  make more effective use of your  time  by 
   downloading    the   directory    menus,...usually    called 
   DISKMENU.DOC.  You can then hang up,  print it off, mark the 
   files you want,  and then call back.   Another effective way 
   to  use these systems is to run WHATSNEW on each disk as you 
   log  into it;  this will list files newly added and  deleted 
   since a specified date.  A separate copy of WHATSNEW is kept 
   on  EACH of the system's drives,  so you'll have to  execute 
   WHATSNEW on each drive in order to see all of the new files.  
   This can be easily done by just prefixing the drive name  to 
   the  command.   For example,  to see what's new on a 3 drive 
   system, type:
   A:WHATSNEW
   B:WHATSNEW
   C:WHATSNEW

14.    It  would be a good idea to practice  file  transferring 
   with someone in the local calling area of yours before going 
   to a distant RCPM. If you do not have a local RCPM, practice 
   with another CP/M user.

15.    Be  sure  to look at the .DOC file or the first part  of 
   the  .ASM  file to learn the purpose or  restrictions  of  a 
   program  before you bother to download it.   If the filetype 
   is AQM or DQC indicating the file is "squeezed",  use TYPESQ 
   to view it.

16.    Be  sure  to type BYE before you log off  to  reset  the 
   system  for the next caller.   If you are hopelessly hung up 
   in a loop, then just hang up and call back in thirty seconds 
   or so; the systems will automatically reset after they sense 
   that the remote caller has hung up the phone.

17.    If you discover a problem with the host  system,  report 
   it  by  leaving  a message on that  bulletin  board,  or  by 
   contacting the SYSOP.  He may never know if someone does not 
   tell  him.  This is an easy way to repay for the use of that 
   system, and it will be appreciated by the SYSOP.

18.    Do NOT use these systems for commercial messages, ethnic 
   jokes,  political commentary,  heavy-breathing messages, and 
   the  like.  Users  are  of all  ages  and  persuasions,  and 
   restraint (or maturity) will be appreciated by all.   If you 
   know of anyone abusing a system,  please discourage  it,  or 
   report it to the SYSOP.   This sort of abuse has resulted in 
   the  loss  of  several  good  RCPM  systems,  wider  use  of 
   passworded systems, and other restrictive curtailments.

19.    Most  remote systems have far more files than are online 
   at any one time. Most will accept requests on their bulletin 
   boards to leave certain files online for you for a specified 
   interval of time,  and on a certain disk and user #.  If you 
   don't see it, look for a .DOC file indicating that the SYSOP 
   offers such help.

20.    Speaking of help, be sure to enter HELP at the A> prompt 
   to learn more about CP/M and what the host system offers.
