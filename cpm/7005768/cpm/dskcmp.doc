                     DISKCOMP.DOC

A file of messages taken from CBBS systems in Oct & Nov l980 relating
to whether or not various S-100 floppy disk controllers are compatible
with various CPUs & other equipment.  While the names of senders and
addressees have been deleted, most are experienced computer users with
no obvious axes to grind--their comments should be a good deal more
trustworthy than those of the average dealer, manufacturer or magazine
reviewer.  The emphasis on the Morrow DJ2D controller only means that
I have one, not that it is an unusually or even averagely
problematical piece of hardware.  The file was maintained using Bill
Brogden's INFORMATION MASTER.

on 10/11/80 RE: DJ2 STATUS

TAKE A LOOK AT MSGS 5102 & 5082 CONCERNING CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH THE
DJ2 AND GODBOUT Z80 BOARD.  MIGHT CHECK TO SEE IF THAT BOARD IS
CURRENT, OR NEEDS BOTH 'FREE' FIXES.... JUMPERS ARE OVIOUSLY FREE, BUT
YOU MIGHT NEED TO CONTACT MORROW FOR A NEW PROM..  73'S...


on 09/24/80 RE: JADE VS. DJ 2D.

SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG TO GET BACK TO YOU.  I AM CURRENTLY RUNNING THE
GODBOUT Z80 WITH MY DJ.  IT WORKS FINE, AS LONG AS THE DJ IS MODIFIED.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DJ'S ARE BEING SHIPPED WITH THE MOD INSTALLED.
(THERE SHOULD BE 3 JUMPERS ON THE BOARD).  IF YOUR BOARD IS NOT
MODIFIED I CAN GIVE IT TO YOU, OR MORROW'S KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM.


on 10/80 RE: DJ2D PROM REPLACEMENT

YOU MAY REMEMBER IN OUR LAST EPISODE THAT I WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE
CRASH OF THE FOURTH DISK, AS THE MONTH-IVERSARY OF ITS FIRST USE
ROLLED AROUND.  SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE KIND ENOUGH TO SUGGEST POSSIBLE
DEFECTS TO CHECK, BUT NONE COULD EXPLAIN WHY MY FIRST THREE, NEW DYSAN
DISKETTES LASTED ONLY A MONTH EACH ON MY NEW SHUGART DRIVES, AND THEN
ONE DAY WOULD PUT THE SYSTEM INTO A COMA WHENEVER I BOOTED.  WELL,
THINKER TOYS SENT OUT A MEMO LAST MONTH NOTING THAT THERE IS AN
"ANOMALY" IN THE 1791 CONTROLLER CHIP THEY USE IN THE DJ2D CONTROLLER
BOARD, AND THAT DJ2D OWNERS SHOULD GET THEIR FREE FIX.  WHEN THE NEW
PROM FOR THE CONTROLLER CAME, EACH OF THE BAD DISKS WORKED PERFECTLY!


on 6/26/80 re: CP/M 2.2 THINKER TOYS

  My thanks to all you noble fellows who had suggestions to read and
write SINGLE DENSITY diskettes on a Discus DJ2D system.
   For those interested 'Single.com' works very effectively in linking
a users single density library with a growing Double Density one if
you are using a single drive.
   However, I have now stripped open Thinker/Lifeboat's implememtation
of CP/M 2.2 and discovered several important features.

    1) The unique way the cbios and boot tables are written extends
    them far beyond the normal allocated memory and disk sector space.

    2) The cbios begins down at 2d00 not 3400h (+bias) so less memory
    is left for application programs and if you wish to move the
    ccp/bdos section and rewrite a smaller boot and cbios --BEWARE
    (cont. next message) the location of the ccp/bdos/cbios is totally
    different in the ddt image and can only be relocated by Movcpm
    at intervals at 2d00h +bias (Even if move it down where it
    belongs)

    3) The reason for all this insanity ? If I had cpm2.2 but a large
    number of single density diskettes I reasoned that a single
    density version could be made only by such manipulative work.
    (You can't fit a 200 # chicken in a shoebox) There are just not
    enough sectors alloted in 2 tracks to store a sysgen of the
    Thinker Toy version.

 Lets face it, I got determined to be able to enjoy the inhancements
of CP/M 2.2 even if on limited storage discs.  It works well now and
I'd be happy to help others in the quest. All that is needed now is
knowledge of the insides of Movcpm or a relocation program to get to
3400. HELP ?


on 05/11/80 re: SD EXPANDORAM II PROBLEMS

FURTHER PROBLEM WITH S.D. SALES EXPANDORAM II - THOSE FOLKS WHO CAN'T
GET THIS BOARD RUNNING WITH THE CROMEMCO PROCESSOR DON'T KNOW HALF THE
TROUBLE!!  THE BOARD USES THE "OR" OF ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT SIGNALS TO
DRIVE AN EDGE-TRIGGERED INPUT.  WITHOUT GETTING BOGGED DOWN IN
DETAILS, THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU HAVE EITHER A FRONT PANEL OR A
MEMORY-MAPPED DISK, FORGET IT!!  IF THE BOARD GOES INTO A WAIT STATE
ON A MEMORY ACCESS FOR MORE THAN 10 CLOCK PERIODS, A HOPELESS DEADLOCK
RESULTS, AND NO REFRESH, READ, OR WRITE CYCLES CAN TAKE PLACE.
REALLY, THIS IS A VERY DISAPPOINTING PIECE OF HARDWARE AND I WISH S.D.
WOULD GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON IT.


on 11/02/80 RE: MY DOUBLE DENSITY STATUS

SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE FOLLOWING MY ESCAPADES ON DD 8" CONTROLLERS.
HERE'S THE LATEST: I WANTED TO BUY A THINKER-TOYS, AS IT HAD SUCH A
GOOD RECOMMENDATION, BUT HELD OUT FOR THE TARBELL 'CAUSE OF DMA.
ORDERED TARBELL, REV E, IT NEVER "QUITE" WORKED.  AFTER MONTHS, BOUGHT
A DJ2D FROM THINKERTOYS, AND IT WORKED.  BUT I FOUND ALL TOO MANY OF
MY OLD PROGRAMS THAT WERE 2.2 INCOMPAT.  FINALLY GOT TARBELL REV F,
AND IT BOOTED ONLY 2 TIMES IN 50.  THIS WEEKEND, DECIDED TO GIVE DJ
ANOTHER TRY, BUT JUST TOO MANY ERRORS OCCURRED - SUCH AS PIPPING FROM
1024 LONG SECT DD TO SINGLE DENSITY - HAD TO MODEM (!!) AN ENTIRE DISK
TO ANOTHER SYSTEM AND BACK TO THE SINGLE DENSITY DISK.  ==> NOTE
HOWEVER THESE ARE PROBABLY NOT PROBLEMS WITH EITHER OF THESE
CONTROLLERS, BUT ARE THE RESULTS OF MY WANTING TO STAY WITH MY "AGING"
ALTAIR, FRONT PANEL, UNBUFFERED MEMORY, AND ALL.  CONCLUSION: I'D NEED
NEW MAINFRAME TO GO DD.


on 11/02/80 RE: CDOS ETC.

YOU JUST FOUND OUT THAT CDOS ISNT 100% COMPATIBLE WITH CP/M.  WELCOME
TO THE CLUB.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, I AM SURPRIZED THAT FAST WORKS WITH
THE VERSION OF CDOS YOU MUST HAVE HAD - BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK WITH
SOME LATE VERSIONS, BECAUSE THE CP/M BRANCH TABLE ISNT USED BY THE
PSEUDO-CCP AT ALL.  ALSO, YOU CANT OVERLAY THE CCP, BECAUSE IT ISNT
RE-READ BY A WARM BOOT, AND THE COLD BOOT ENTRY POINT IN THE TABLE IS
A DUMMY, AND THE CCP DOES NOT PUT A RETURN ADDRESS ON THE STACK BEFORE
GOING TO THE USER PROGRAM, AND THE ALLOCATION BITMAP SCHEME IS
COMPATIBLE WITH CP/M 1.3, NOT 1.4 OR 2.2, ETC.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME
DIRECTORY INCOMPATIBILITIES FOR "SYSTEM" ENTRIES.

...TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT, I USE A MICROMATION DOUBLER CONTROLLER
BOARD, WITH A MODIFIED PROM SO IT DOESNT WIPE OUT 1K OF THE ADDRESS
SPACE, AND IT HAS WORKED ON EVERY SYSTEM I HAVE EVER TRIED IT ON, FP
AND ALL, Z80 OR 8080.


on 11/06/80 RE: N*+8"

I HAVE TWO SYSTEMS. ONE A N* SINGLE DENSITY, THE OTHER AN 8" SYSTEM.
I "LOGICALLY" PUT THEM TOGETHER: DEPENDING UPON WHICH IS MASTER, I
PATCH THE JMP TABLE TO A ROUTINE WHICH LOOKS TO SEE IF THE DRIVE BEING
SELECTED IS BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE LOCAL SYSTEM, AND IF SO, MAKES A
9600 BAUD "REQUEST" TO THE OTHER SYSTEM "R/TRK/SECT/" OR
"W/TRACK/SECT/....DATA...."  ALL TRANSFER IS CHECKSUMMED, SO JUST LIKE
MY MODEM PROGRAM, ERRORS ARE RE-TRANSMITTED.  ITS SLOW, BUT ALLOWS ME
TO USE THE N* SYSTEM AS A MODEM/ CBBS CALLER, ETC, WHILE KEEPING THE
8" OPEN FOR DEVELOPMENT, LISTING, ETC.  THEN WHEN REALLY NECESSARY TO
MODEM SOMEONE AN 8" DISK, I CAN EASILY LINK THE SYSTEMS, AND SEND THE
8" DIRECTLY (VIA THE 9600 BAUD LINE).  THE SLAVE SYSTEM IS TOTALLY
DEDICATED - I'M NOT RUNNING MPM OR ANY SUCH.  LIFEBOAT USES
CO-RESIDENT N* AND 8" TO DO U.G. FILE TRANSFERS.  ONE CP/M RUNNING
"INSIDE" THE OTHER.


on 11/06/80 RE: DD CONTROLLER

RE: YOUR DD ESCAPADES, I HAVE BEEN USING MICROMATION DD CONTROLLER FOR
ABOUT 1-1/2 YRS AND HAVE HAD **NO** PROBLEMS OF ANY KIND. EASY TO
MODIFY, TOO, BECAUSE OF ONBOARD 2708. BUT NOT DMA. KNOW OF ONE OTHER
USER WHO IS ALSO PLEASED, USING DD ON DOUBLE-SIDED DRIVES (QUME) UNDER
CP/M 2.X ON N* (!!!) SYSTEM (YES, HE CAN TRANSFER FROM 5" TO 8" AND
VICE VERSA).


TECHNICAL BBS-DETROIT:  INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM
                        Updated: 10/18/80

  The system consists of an IMSAI 8080 mainframe, PMMI MM-103 modem,
62k of RAM, 2k of EPROM, two double-density double-sided 8" floppy
drives, one double-density single- sided 8" drive and a Morrow's DJ2D
controller.


on 10/06/80 RE: VERSAFLOPPY II

EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL HERE. I GOT MY SDOS AND WAS NOT IMPRESSED.
WANT TO BUY IT?  LOOKS LIKE WARMED OVER CDOS TO ME.  BY THE WAY, I GOT
MY PL-I A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.  LOOKS REAL NEAT, I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO
REALLY GET INTO IT.  IF I CAN GET A COUPLE EPROMS BURNED I WILL BE
GOING TO A 60K SYSTEM.  I HAD TO PACK THE VERSAFLOPPY BIOS AND VDM-1
DRIVERS IN MY F0 PAGE OF MEMORY.  I DEBUGGED IT LAST WEEKEND AND LOOKS
LIKE EVERYTHING IS OK.  THE SYSTEM IS WORKING NICE, I THINK THE WORD
IS GETTING AROUND.  I AM GETTING CALLS FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE.  I
DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE SO MANY APPLES AND PET USERS OUT THERE.
KEEP IN TOUCH, CUL.


on 11/09/80 RE: PIP

1.  I DON'T THINK PIP IS MACHINE DEPENDENT.

2.  I HEARD EARLY VERSIONS OF PIP (PRE 2.2) HAD PROBS.

3.  YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE "[O" OPTION (TO PIP OBJSECT INFO).
THEORETICALLY, PIP IS SUPPOSED TO STOP AT THE FIRST ^Z IT FINDS - AND
.COM FILES TYPICALLY HAVE THEM AS PART OF THE CODE.  PERHAPS THE BUG
IN PIP IS THAT THEY DIDN'T DEFAULT TO [O MODE WHEN PIPPING A .COM
FILE.  "2.011" MAKES IT SOUND LIKE A SPECIAL N* RELEASE.  BY THE WAY,
DID YOU GET THIS FROM LIFEBOAT?  THEY, IN MY OPINION, ARE VERY
"RESPONSIBLE" - DID YOU ASK T-H-E-M ABOUT PIP?

 
on 10/31/80 Re: DISK CONTROLLER FOR SALE

        i have a MORROW DJ2D controller card which i am willing to
sell or trade. it is double density, memory mapped, has serial port on
board, rom on board, buffer on board. should work in any 8080/Z80
s-100 system with >16K and at leAst 1 8" drive. it takes up 2K at
EOOh, and is slow (by comparison to a DMA controller), so i'm
unloading. will trade for TARBELL SINGLE DENSITY plus some cash, or
more stuff. Will trade for authentic IMSAI FRONT PANEL plus cash or
more stuff. comes with DISK-ATE and V-BASIC, CP/M available. New value
~$425.00


on 11/12/80 RE: CBBS

AS TO THE DJ2D, xx HAD PROBLEMS WITH HIS AND GOT A NEW CONTROLLER
CHIP.  WHILE I DONT USE THAT BOARD, THE SYMPTOM IS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT
WHEN I HAD A BUG IN MINE WHERE THERE WAS A CRC ERROR IN THE SECTOR
COUNT FIELD ON THE DISK-IT RAN FOREVER.  A NEW CHIP CURED THAT
PROBLEM, AND IT NOW REPORTS THE CRC ERROR INSTEAD OF GOING TO
NEVER-NEVER LAND.


on 11/12/80 RE: ANOTHER CP/M

I'M PRETTY WELL CONVINCED THAT MY PROBLEM IS DUE TO TRYING TO PUT A
SUPERCHARGED AVANTI ENGINE IN MY '52 STUDEBAKER.  THE OLD ALTAIR WITH
ITS LOOSE BIRDSNEST OF FRONT PANEL WIRES, JUST CAN'T HACK SOME THINGS.
I TRIED A SIMPLE "SAVE 80 FOO" AND IT ALSO BLEW AWAY.  I'M NEXT GOING
TO SEE IF SAVING AND PIPPING SO LONG AS I STAY IN 1024 SECTOR SIZE,
WORKS, I.E. THE GLITCHES MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR TECHNIQUE OF
READING THE WRONG LENGTH RECORDS, GETTING AN ERROR, RESETTING SIZE,
AND TRYING AGAIN (EGAD - IT WRITES SINGLE DENSITY ONLY 1 SECTOR/REV).
I'VE ALREADY TRIED A BORROWED CP/M.  I'M GONNA ANALYZE THE BIOS, AND
CONVERT A STAND-ALONE TARBELL TEST PROGRAM TO WORK ON THE DJ IF THAT
WILL BE WHAT IT TAKES.  THANKS FOR THE IDEAS <K>


on 11/12/80 RE: DJ

SEE MSG 5794 IF ITS STILL HERE, IF NOT, THE NET OF IT WAS I'M NOW
BLAMING MY ANCIENT ALTAIR FRONT PANEL, AND POSS.  THE DJ TECHNIQUE OF
MIS-READING 128 BYTE SECTORS BY TRYING 1024 FIRST (OR SOME SUCH).  I'M
NOW LOOKING AT BIOS.  SAVE 80 FOO DIDN'T WORK, EITHER - AFTER A DOZEN
OR SO WRITES, IT BLEW.  I SID'D PIP, AND T-H-E-N IT WORKED!
..SINCE I MUSTA SLOWED THINGS DOWN BY THE TRACE.  THANKS
FOR YOUR IDEAS - I HAVE KEPT THE MSG ON MY SYS. <K>


on 11/11/80 RE: PIP WITH DJ2D

NEVER THOUGHT OF SUSPECTING PIP!!  (BUT SYMPTOMS APPEAR TO BE HARDWARE
- I.E. LOCKED UP BUS).  I DO HAVE CP/M 2.2 DIRECT FROM DIGITAL
RESEARCH - I HEARD AN EARLIER VERSION DID HAVE ERRORS SO WENT TO THE
2.2 VERS.  I'LL TRY SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DO INTENSIVE WRITES -
COME TO THINK OF IT, ASSEMBLING MY BIOS DIDN'T BLOW - ALTHO I WROTE
ONLY A .HEX FILE.  WILL RE-TRY WITH PRN OPTION.  ALSO x GAVE ME A FIX
RELATED TO Z-80, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE IT MIGHT HELP.  P.S.  WHAT IS
THE # ON YOUR PROM?  MINE IS "B/V2". <K>


on 11/10/80 TO DJ2D OWNERS RE: WHATSITMEAN?

SOME TIMES MY DJ2D JUST HANGS UP WITH THE DISK SELECT LIGHT ON - SUCH
AS WHEN PIPPING FROM SINGLE DENSITY TO DOUBLE DENSITY.  EVEN STOPPING
THE COMPUTER DOESN'T HELP.  I SHOULD THINK THE CHIP WOULD TIME OUT IF
IT WASN'T FINDING SECTOR INFO, NO?  ANY/ALL HELP WOULD BE APPREC.
INCIDENTALLY, ITS A "F" (FUJUTSU?) CHIP.


on 11/13/80 TO ALL RE: DJ2D LATEST

THE LATEST ON MY DJ2D IS THAT IT SEEMS TO WORK FLAWLESSLY WITH 1024
BYTE SECTORS.  ONLY WRITING TO A-N-Y OTHER SIZE DOESN'T WORK.  128 IS
HOW I FIRST FOUND IT, BUT TONIGHT I FORMATTED A 512 BYTE SECTOR
DISKETTE, AND DID "SAVE 128 B:FOO" AND IT BLEW AWAY JUST LIKE SINGLE
DENSITY.  I'M GONNA TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THE BIOS DETECTS,
SWITCHES, AND SETS DENSITY.  ANY ADDITIONAL IDEAS?


on 11/18/80 re: DJ

I "have" the users manual on the DJ, and was complaining about the
lack of subroutine documentation in the PROM listing. (The code is
well commented, but each "routine" doesn't have "who I am what I do,
what I receive, and what I return.  However I guess I partially know
why its so slow - in documentation of "READ" on page 9, it says "Head
motion (including a head load) or change of disk drive will cause the
firmware to verify the track position by doing a "read header"
operation - that's silly.  All diskettes have tracks 1-76 the same
density so once its determined, density should never be tested again.
Only a HOME operation should cause a density select.  As to sector
skew: there is a "transportability" standard for single density CP/M,
so that is "inviolate".  Say, how about someone else (you?) with a
front panel watching the lights to see how fast single density sectors
are written to B: via "save 80 b:foo" on an otherwise blank disk?
Mine "obviously" writes only 6 sectors (revs)/sec P.S. I noticed your
note to x asking if you should spend $$ for a TDL ZPU with hope of
hitting 4mhz: No.  First, TDL only originally promised 4MHz, didn't
"necessarily" deliver (a friend wrote them to verify that they would
inform customers when 4MHz became available, and they flatly said
"no").  Also, the DJ requires "true" 8080 clock phases - i.e.  phase 1
a certain "distance" from phase 2.  TDL "cheated" and just inverted
one to get the other, so they don't have the proper separation.  I.E.
a TDL Z-80 board won't work with DJ even at 2M!  I have a TDL ZPU as a
"spare" but find it doesn't work with several things I have - i.e.
graphics board, Tarbell single density, etc.


on 11/20/80 to ALL re: TARBELL DD & VECTOR Z80

 I DONT REALLY KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE, BUT THE OTHER DAY, THAT MY VECTOR
GRAPHIC Z80 CPU WOULDN'T WORK WITH THE DD DISK CONTROLLER.
 BY THE WAY - WHATS THE LATEST REVISION ON THE TARBELL DD.  THE LAST I
HEARD, IT WAS REVISION "F".


on 11/22/80 RE: RAM & CPU ???

   WHICH RAM AND WHICH CPU BOARD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.  ALSO, WHAT
CONTROLLER BOARD DO YOU HAVE?
           <<<<<  WHAT LIST ???  >>>>>>
  I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE TARBELL DD BOARD 'CAUSE I NEED
TO UPGRADE FROM MY SNGL DNSTY DISKS.  I WANT TO SET UP A SYSTEM WITH
MPM , BUT DON'T WANT THE SLOWDOWN OF PDT DISK CONTROLLERS. RIGHT NOW
IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE 3 CHOICES OF A DMA DD CONTROLLER:
   1) TARBELL - MOST HAVE GOOD WORDS FOR REV. F
   2) ITHACA INTERSYSTEMS - I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO KNOWS
                            ANYONE WHO OWNS ONE.
   3) DELTA - SAME AS <2> ABOVE
 IF YOU HAVE A REV. F TARBELL, I WOULD LIKE YOUR OPINION ABOUT IT.
SOME PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO INPLEMENT DMA
OPERATION WITH THEIR REV. F'S HAVE YOU?
   AS FOR THE Z80 CPU'S NOT WORKING WITH TARBELL'S CONTROLLER, IT MAY
BE BECAUSE SOME Z80 BOARDS MAY NOT "MIMIC" THE 8080 BUS SIGNALS
EXACTLY.  ONE EXAMPLE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY: THE ORIGINAL TDL Z80
BOARD INSTEAD OF GENERATING A PHASE 2 CLOCK, MERELY INVERTED THE PHASE
1 CLOCK.
 I'M GOING TO CALL TARBELL AND FIND OUT WHICH BRAND OF CPU HE USES
WITH HIS IN-HOUSE EQUIPMENT.  I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS.
     SEE YOU LATER

on 11/25/80 TO ALL RE: DJ2D AND TARBELL DD

 I HAVE BOTH THE TARBELL DD AND THE THINKERTOYS DJ2D CONTROLLERS. BOTH
WORK FINE WITH ALL 8080 CPU'S, BUT BOTH ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO Z-80S
 THERE IS A MOD TO THE LATEST DJ2D TO MAKE IT MORE TOLERANT OF Z80S.
THE ONLY Z80 THAT I HAVE FOUND TO WORK WITH THE TARBELL IN DMA IS THE
CALIFORNIA COMPUTER SYSTEMS.  THIS COMBINATION IS WORKING FINE IN
MULTI BYTE SECTOR BIOS'S AND MP/M. THE TARBELL IS THE ONLY CONTROLLER
TO RUN MP/M PROPERLY.  MARK WINKLERS XIOS IS THE CONNECTION FOR THE
PROPER OPERATION OF MP/M. THE VECTOR GRAPHIC Z80 WILL WRK WITH THE
DJ2D WITH THE THINKERTOYS MOD. BOTH CONTROLLERS ONLY LIKE -REAL-
MEMORY (STATIC, OF COURSE).
