Re:   CPM list

Frank,
I would be very interested in a CPM mailing list.  Not sure I
could contribute  much, but it would certainly help my CPM
education.

Frank,

pls add my name to the info-c mailing list.  my current mailing

incidentally, I have a copy of an implementation of the MODEM2
protocol written in BDS C by Jack Wierda.  Is it the same as the
one you have?

A bunch of us around here are purchasing the Amethyst package
(MINCE, SCRIBBLE, and BDS C) in a "site" purchase.  Will let you

Haven't heard from info-cpm.  Is it alive?

To:   INFO-CPM

I am considering the purchase of a Heathkit H89 computer and have not
been able to decide whether or not to spend more $ ($200) for CPM instead
of the Heath operating system, HDOS.  HDOS comes with a lousy Basic but
CPM doesn't, which accounts for most of the cost.  Does anyone have
any ideas about the differences between HDOS and CPM and what you
consider to be the advantages of CPM?  I have also noticed the software
in the CPM account.  I think that HDOS has the same 8080 assembler.
Would most of the software be compatable with both HDOS and CPM or does
it have specific CPM functions?

Thanks,
	-Michael Adler

P.S.  Could I be put on the mailing INFO-CPM mailing list?
