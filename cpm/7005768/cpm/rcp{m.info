     to updates of the list should be placed here]

    + Interested in setting up a RCPM system of your own?   +
    + Read the comments on programs at the end of this file +

1.  The  systems listed here only carry programs that will  run 
   under the CP/M operating system,  most of them public domain 
   software  distributed by CPMUG or SIG/M,  the two main  CP/M 
   users'  groups.   Some of the programs involved  (especially 
   those  in  BASIC and PASCAL but also a few in Z-80  or  8080 
   assembly language) can be converted to run on other machines 
   quite easily.  But systems dedicated to downloading programs 
   for	the PET,  APPLE,  TRS-80 and NORTHSTAR do  exist.   Ask 
   experienced	users  in your area,  or check	through  "other 
   systems" listings on local CBBS's, ABBS's, FORUM-80's, etc.

2.  XMODEM  is	a modification of Ward	Christensen's  original 
   MODEM  program  designed  to allow  the  transfer  of  files 
   between the exchange system and yours.   The exchange system 
   needs the program,  not you;  you will probably be using one 
   of  the  many  versions  of	MODEM  itself:	 e.g.,	MODEM2, 
   MODEM527, MODEM7, MBOOT, etc.

3.  Non-XMODEM program transfer systems are starting to appear: 
   e.g., LICA's BBS on Long Island [at (516) 561-6590; 110-600+ 
   baud;  24  hrs]  has a few downloadable ASCII files	but  at 
   present  (01/8l)  these must be captured like CBBS  messages 
   and then saved to disk, without any error-checking protocol. 
   Santa Clara CBBS [at (408) 241-1956;110-600+ baud;  24  hrs) 
   has	announced  plans  to  implement  late-night  exchanges; 
   whether these will use XMODEM is not yet clear.

4.  Some XMODEM systems also operate as real CBBS's,  including 
   those operated by Dick Mead and Steve Vinokouroff.	Others, 
   like Keith Petersen's &  CCCC's  use a  skeletal  subprogram
   for handling messages called "MINICBBS".   Their emphasis is 
   on exchanging software, not bulletin board-type information.
   Most RBBS systems focus on software, but even here there are
   variations...

5.  A  few CBBSs have software exchange functions that	require 
   the use of a password.  Such systems are not listed here.

6.  At	present  (03/81)  the  systems with  the  largest  disk 
   capacity and the most programs up at once are Kelly	Smith's 
   and	Keith Petersen's,  both running 10 Mb hard disks.  Bill
   Earnest's has a 4.25 Mb hard disk,  all for RCPM use.   Dave 
   Hardy's, with 3 Morrow-controlled drives giving @ 3 Mb is in 
   4th place.	Rick Martinek & Calamity Cliffs say  they  have
   plans  to  go  over	to hard  disk  quite  soon.  Dick  Mead 
   (Pasedena CBBS) will have a 10 Mb hard disk up in 2 weeks.

7.  Note: look for the appearance of a new RCPM on this list to
   appear in 2-3 weeks based  in Resada,  California (213  area
   code),  with 500 Kb floppies and 10 Mb hard disk.  System is
   checked out	(XMODEM, RIBBS, etc.),	SYSOP  (Ed Currie)  now
   waiting for installation of telephone.

8.  No RCPM (or straight CBBS) system is currently running MP/M 
   or  another multi-tasking OS in combination with  more  than 
   one modem & telephone line.	Footnote:  Kelly Smith did have 
   MP/M  running (2 user's) for 3 months,  but reverted back to 
   "normal"  CP/M  because the average caller did  not	utilize 
   most  of the new facilities or were overwhelmed by  the  the 
   system capabilities. After hard disks,this is expected to be 
   the	 next  important  development  in  non-profit  computer 
   communications.  Tim Nicholas is currently working on a two-
   modem system and expects to be up with it shortly.

9.  The fastest system is Tim Nicholas's, with a Bell 212-type
   modem capable of 1200 baud, full duplex, at the same freque-
   cies other micro modems use. He will soon have a half-duplex
   1200-baud modem running as well.    Any of the systems using 
   PMMIs can sometimes reach 710 baud but usually are  untrust-
   worthy beyond 600 baud.   Systems based on D.C.Hayes & other
   brands of modem do not send or receive faster than 300 baud.
   While IDS on-board modems and at  least one of the externals
   are capable of  reaching 600, none  has yet been  used in an
   RCPM system.

10. And please, most of these systems operate from private home
   telephones...   be courteous and call only during the posted
   operating hours.

11. Helpful Hint, CBBS/RBBS Log-on: Getting to CP/M FAST!

    On	some RCPM systems that sign-on	with CBBS or  the  RBBS 
   message  programs,  would  you just as soon get to the  CP/M 
   files as soon as possible and cut through all the B**L S**T?

    Well here's the method I use to do it, with an example that 
   applies  to	either CBBS (copyright,  Ward  Christensen)  or 
   RBBS (public domain,  courtesy of Bruce Ratoff).  I hope you 
   find  this  helpfull,  and it should save you some money  on 
   your telephone bill!  Best regards;	Kelly  Smith,  CP/M-Net 
   (tm) SYSOP, (805) 527-9321.

    Ever notice that both program always (EVENTUALLY) will ask: 
   (1) first time user?  (2) first name ? (3) last name ?, etc. 
   and	so  on,  and  so on...well FIRST  OF  ALL,  answer  the 
   question  "HOW  MANY NULLS?" and "CAN YOUR  TERMINAL  HANDLE 
   LOWER  CASE"...then	hold down Control-C on	your  key-board 
   'till  the only remaining thing you see on your terminal  is 
   '?'...it's now waiting for your 'Y/N' response to the "First 
   time user?" question. Then:

    This  works on Dick Mead's Pasadena CBBS,  (213)  799-1632, 
   and always shows 00 minutes logged on...now THAT'S FAST!:

     .-- No, not first time on system
     | .-- First name
     | |    .-- Last name
     | |    |	   .-- Goodbye
     | |    |	   | .-- No comment
     | |    |	   | |	
     n;Imma;Hacker;g;n<cr>

    But  DON'T	use  this on Bruce  Ratoff's  Remote  CP/M  and 
   Bulletin Board System of Cranford, New Jersy (201) 272-1874, 
   that uses his RBBS program... if you say "Goodbye",	he will 
   promptly disconnect! So use this (almost identical) method:

     .-- No, not first time on system
     | .-- First name
     | |    .-- Last name
     | |    |	   .-- CP/M (how clever...'C' for CP/M!)
     | |    |	   |
     n;Imma;Hacker;c<cr>

    There  may	be 'variations on a theme',  so watch  out  for 
   other systems that may (or may not) work similarly...now how 
   about  it  guys  and gals (?)...any one want to  start-up  a 
   'standards commitee' so we all operate pretty much the same?


13. RUNNING YOUR OWN REMOTE CP/M SYSTEM   [Ben Bronson, 3/21]

If you want to put up a bulletin board or a program exchange
system that runs under CP/M (and if you don't want to write all
your own software from scratch) you have two choices: Ward
Christensen's and Randy Suess's assembly-language CBBS and the
BASIC-language RBBS written by Howard Moulton, Bruce Ratoff,
Ron Fowler, Tim Nicholas and others.

CBBS, although originally intended for bulletin board use,
has been extended for RCPM functions by several sysops,
including Dick Mead and Steve Vinokouroff.  Setting it up
requires good assembly-language programming skills.  To get it,
send a check for $50 made out to Randy Suess to: CBBS, 5219
W Warwick, Chicago, Ill. 60641.  You will receive a copy of
the CBBS source program and files on 2 CP/M format soft
sectored 8" floppy disks.

MINICBBS requires much less knowledge of assembler and is well
adapted to RCPM use.  Keith Petersen adapted it from the full
CBBS, and it can be obtained from him or any of the other
sysops who use it: Dave Hardy, Dave Moritz, Calamity Cliffs,
etc.  However, as CBBS is copyrighted and as MINICBBS needs
several of the auxiliary and maintenance programs supplied on
the CBBS distribution disks) they will only release it to
those who have bought CBBS.

The main (and only) alternative to the CBBS series is RBBS or
its two RCPM-specialized descendants, ENTERBBS and MINIRBBS.
They can probably be obtained on this system.

All are written in MBASIC 5 and can be set up and altered by
persons with a minimal knowledge of that language.  The RBBS
programs must be compiled with BASCOM unless you are satis-
fied with very slow response tmes.

RBBS25.ASC or BAS is the current version of the standard RBBS
(or RIBBS) program.  It resembles the full CBBS quite closely
(except in its poorer message editing features and its greater
bulk when compiled) and can be used as an orthodox bulletin
board program.	However, it also has built-in capability to
serve as the front end to an RCPM system and is so used by most
RBBS sysops: e.g., Bruce Ratoff, Ron Fowler, and David Kozinn.

ENTERBBS and MINIRBBS (ENTBBS24 & MINBBS25.BAS/ASC) are spec-
ialized versions of RBBS aimed at RCPM use with minimal
message-handling capability.  They are currently used by Tim
Nicholas, Ben Bronson and Chuck Witbeck.

RBSUTL22.BAS/ASC is the message maintenance program that works
with any of the RBBS series.  RBBS-USE.DOC gives some of the
special information you would need in actually setting an RBBS
system up.
