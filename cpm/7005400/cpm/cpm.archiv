MADLER@MIT-ML 08/30/81 16:24:37 Re: locating sectors with the BIOS on a H/Z89
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-ML
Having just completed an interrupt driven MODEM program for use in normal
communications and file transfer (for computers without special dumping
software) I have come across a problem with interrupt driven character
input while performing disk operations on a Heathkit H89 using Heath's
CP/M.  In the BIOS, subroutine LPS (locate proper sector) disables interrupts,
thus causing dropped characters.  Does anybody know whether or not interrupts
are disabled simply to eliminate interference by the 2ms clock or is timing
critical and interference by any process would cause problems.  If
only the former is true, I could modify this subroutine to turn off the
2ms clock and maintain other interrupts.  If it is the latter, I may have
to suffer from dropped characters!

Also, has anybody modified Heathkit's CP/M BIOS successfully?  I tried once
but their instructions were sparse and seemed not to apply.  If anybody could
describe exactly how the BIOS is modified and then how a new system disk
is created I would really appreciate it!!!

Thanks,
-Michael Adler

Subject:  Call for advice and info on the Apple/CPM/Amethyst connection
To: INFO-APPLE at MIT-AI, AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI, INFO-CPM at MIT-AI,
    INFO-MICRO at MIT-AI

Dear Apple users, Amethyst users, and CPM people,
   I am a new owner of an Apple II plus, and would appreciate help and
advice from more experienced users. My questions break down into 2 
groups: (1) questions concerning the system I hope to build
around my Apple, and (2) general questions about things I don't 
understand yet. 

My sincere apologies for both the length of this inquiry, and the
redundancy to many of you who are on more than one of the mailing lists.
My thanks for your patience and your help.

BACKGROUND:
	Things I would like to do with my Apple:
		Text editing (writing papers, reports, and student evaluations)
		Programming (my previous experience is with LISP and LOGO)
		Teach my wife programming in LOGO
		Games and Puzzles (Sargon chess, backgammon, various "arcade games")
		Graphics hacking / art work
		Terminal dial up to larger systems (Cyber and Vax in Amherst
			area, and MIT-AI if I can obtain an inexpensive connection
			from Northampton-- this latter would be especially 
			helpful to me)
		LISP programming and perhaps even some of my thesis research (AI)
	    (i am unsure as to the feasibility of some of these things and would
		appreciate your disabusing me of any unrealistic fantasies)

	My current system consists of:
		48k Apple II plus
		Apple disk drive (5.25 in.) with DOS 3.3
		Epson MX-80 printer
		Home color TV (19" with SupRMod modulator)

FANTASY SYSTEM:
    The following is the tentative plan I have for expanding my system.
It is driven largely by my desire to run the AMETHYST software (MINCE 
and SCRIBBLE).
	SOFTCARD Z80 with CPM (so as to be able to run MINCE, etc.)
	80 column, upper/lower case display
	2nd disk drive (5.25 in.)
	16k RAMCARD (to extend to 64k)
	modem
	(color monitor?)
	
QUESTIONS ON SYSTEM EXPANSION:

0. Is my "fantasy system" feasible? That is, WILL IT WORK??
   I am especially anxious to learn of any interaction effects
   or incompatibilities of pieces of the system I am considering.
   Are there components or angles I've overlooked? 

1. Will there be enough slots to put it all together (i count 6)? 
   Will some of them be wanting to go in the same slot?
   Will the Apple heat up and/or explode with all those boards plugged in??
   If so, is it a solution to remove the power supply to outside the Apple
   casing? Would a good fan be adequate to do the job?

2. Is it worth the bother (and expense). I think I can scrounge up
   the money, but will I be reasonably satisfied with the final result
   or will I have only an expensive kludge?

3. Has anyone already tried a similar system? I would be EXTREMELY
   INTERESTED in corresponding with you to learn how it worked out!!

4. Are people happy with the Amethyst package? What are peoples' experiences
   with MINCE and SCRIBBLE on the Apple? How does SCRIBBLE fare when
   combined with the Epson MX-80?

5. Are there radical alternatives I should consider before committing
   myself further to this project? (eg. selling the Apple and building
   or acquiring an alternative system?) How serious a constraint is the
   8 bit processor and 64k address space?? 

6. Any specific recommendations or warnings regarding alternative hardware
   (such as 80 column boards, 16k ram cards, and modems)? In particular
   I am curious as to which (if any) of the 80 column boards would impose the
   least drain on the power supply? 

7. Will a home tv provide adequate resolution for 80 column upper/lower
   case display? How much additional resolution would I get from a color
   monitor (for both text and graphics)?

8. Do ALL the 80 column boards automatically provide upper/lower case display?
   (I'm currently inclined toward the Videx Videoterm)

9. Is the Videx Keyboard Enhancer redundant with the Videoterm board?
   (if not, is it a reasonable way to upgrade the keyboard?)
   What is the best way for me to obtain keyboard entry of upper/lower case
   and other ascii characters (preferably using the shift key)??

10. What should I look for in a modem? Is the Hayes Micromodem II everything
   its cracked up to be? Are there reasonable 1200 baud modems for the
   Apple?

11. Will Apple Pascal software run on the alternative 16k ram boards (Andromeda,
	Microsoft RAMCARD, etc.)? Would I really want Apple Pascal anyway?

12. Does anyone have experience with any of the "friction feed" add-ons for
   the MX-80 (such as Orange Micro's, or the one advertised for $15)? 
   What about the dot graphics updrade (do I correctly recall they claimed
   this will also provide italic fonts?)?

13. How can I get the best prices on equipment I purchase? Are mail order
   houses generally reliable, or are some of them fly-by-nighters that may
   take my money and run? Are there ways I can get wholesale prices on
   single quantity (I expect I'm dreaming, but it can't hurt to ask).

14. Is service a big issue with micro-computer ownership? (I've only had my
   system for 3 weeks now). Should I be wary of Mail Order houses on this
   account?

GENERAL INFORMATIONAL QUESTIONS:

1. Could some kind and patient soul please explain to me what is involved
   in Up and Down Loading? I understand (i think) that they have to do
   with shipping files (or is it just programs? -- please clarify) back
   and forth between micros and mainframes. Are the problems primarily due
   to differences in word size? or are there other more subtle issues that
   I can't imagine?

2. Has anyone developed a central catalog of software purchased or written
   by various people who would be willing to share their resources?

3. Any suggestions as to my best means for hooking into MIT-AI from the
   Northampton/Amherst area? Can I do network hopping through any commercial
   networks at reasonable prices? Are long distance phone lines reliable
   for transmitting information, or are they too noisy? Any and all suggestions
   will be gratefully accepted (and shared with our own Dave McDonald (DDM) who
   is also located in Amherst).

4. Can one get away with "turning over" diskettes and using the other side?
   One can cut out a second "write enable" hole, and store things on both
   sides of a diskette. Is there any danger of information bleed-through
   from using both sides simultaneously for storage?? Does the risk become
   greater as the disk surfaces wear away??

Thank you again for your patience and help. My apologies for this inordinately
long message. I'm very anxious to get on as quickly as possible to expanding
my system, but I'd like to benefit from all your prior experiences.
Apologies also for the redundancy entailed in my sending this to the several
"micro" mailing lists.

Subject: Diskette library control
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC


The following was left on my RCPM system.  I don't normally
forward long messages to a mailing list like this one, but
felt this one was of such universal interest it was worth
making an exception.

LIBRARY.CTL   Microcomputer Diskette Library Control.

04/25/81.     T. McCormick.


	Control  of computer libraries is well developed in large 
computer  operations.  Only  tiny operations can get  by  without 
specific  rules for naming programs and data  files,  segregating 
test files from production, indicating as-of dates, etc.

	With the rapid growth of microcomputer use,  and with the 
continual improvement in disk storage capacity per  dollar,  many 
business  and  hobby users are discovering that with  no  library 
plan,  too  much time and effort are wasted looking for the right 
version, starting to run the wrong version...again, etc.

	It  is  possible  to acquire and  store  more  files  and 
programs than you can manage without some library system.

	Micro operating systems,  editors, and utilities offer an 
occasional  assist  in one way or another such as  creating  .BAK 
backup  file copies automatically.   But the user is left to  put 
his  library control scheme together by himself.  He often  lacks 
the  experience  which comes from years of grappling  with  these 
problems,  and  is  forced to discover solutions one at  a  time.  
This results in a weak start, and continual change.

	I have made many mistakes related to computer  libraries, 
and  have  seen many others.   As computer center manager  for  a 
nationwide accounting firm, we daily were working with files from 
all kinds of outside program libraries.   I would like to pass on 
a  few suggestions based on my experience with about 300 computer 
libraries over an eleven year period.

	The following is not intended as a exact prescription for 
you,  you will have to decide what fits,  and what doesn't.  I'll 
use  my library control methods as an example,  knowing that  you 
will have to adapt it to your circumstances.

	Here is a summary of important rules:

	1.  Never alter a "distribution" diskette in any  way.  A 
distribution  diskette is one you receive from someone else,  and 
for which you usually have paid money.   You may have to send  it 
back  to get a new release at the "update" price rather than  buy 
another  license!   You may not be able to read it next year  and 
you  want a fresh copy at nominal charge.  You may want to get  a 
bug fixed at no charge.  Do NOT change anything on this diskette. 
N O T H I N G . 

	2.  A program that is one bit, one byte, or one statement 
different  from another MUST have a different name.   There is no 
such thing as	"same as....,  except".  Resist the temptation to 
leave the names the same when they are "only slightly" different.  
Subtle differences are hard to sort out six months later!  Subtle 
differences may be much harder to find than large differences  or 
gross errors.

	3. Follow your system rigidly.

	4. Label things immediately, while they are fresh in your 
mind.  Little peel-off dots and labels are inexpensive,  and easy 
to use.  Office supply stores have a rainbow assortment (Avery is 
one  of the brand names) and they are cheap.   Color  coding  can 
segregate  test from permanent files,  release 2 from release  3, 
etc. without any writing.

	5.   Begin  library  control  at  once:  it  gets  harder 
geometrically as you acquire more stuff.

	6.  When you initialize/format a diskette,  place a small 
peel-off  label  (I  use  one-inch  dots  on  it  indicating  the 
operating system version you used, date, and density or format if 
you have more than one. Eventually, you will have more than one.

	7.  Specifically  label backup copies,  and write-protect 
them.  Store them separately from daily-use diskettes. Store them 
inside,  where the humidity and temperature are fairly  constant. 
Exchange  backup storage with another user,  if you can.  Do  not 
store diskettes or cassettes in your car trunk!

	Why bother with backup?   Have you ever entered 

	A>ERA *.*     instead of    A>ERA B:*.*    or

	A>PIP A:=B:*.*[V]  instead of
	      B:=A:*.*[V]

	HUMMMM?

	You say you're not that stupid??   OK.


	8.   Establish  categories,   and  label  your  diskettes 
accordingly.	For example, Proprietary software such as MBASIC, 
CP/M, etc could be replaced by a dealer.  Your modifications, and 
custom programs could not.  They should be protected to a greater 
degree.

	9. Never keep all your backup in one place. Two suitcases 
ten  miles  apart  is  more secure  than  one  bomb-proof  vault.  
Remember, with all the electrical equipment in one computer room, 
a  small  fire could destroy alot of diskettes in a  hurry.   Bet 
you've got 'em stored close by so they'll be nice and handy too!

       10.  Data-file diskettes change periodically.  Use a peel-
off label to indicate clearly the filenames,  and as-of date.  Do 
not  store  backup  of  data files on  the  same  diskette  under 
different filenames.  Diskettes can become unusable no matter how 
careful you are.

       11. I recognize three flavors of diskettes:
		a. never used.
		b. initialized/formatted, not used.
		c. in use, contains one or more files.

Come  up with a scheme to indicate each of these.  I do not put a 
peel-off file label on never-used diskettes.  If I see a diskette 
with  no  peel-off  label  at  all,   I  know  it  has  not  been 
initialized/formatted.   When I initialize/format a  diskette,  I 
place  a  one-inch  colored dot on it  indicating  the  operating 
system  version,  today's date,  and the recording format/density 
with  which it was initialized/formatted.  Such diskettes have  a 
directory,  but  do not have any files.  Every diskette  of  mine 
which  contains a file has a large peel-off label indicating  the 
name(s),  or something else indicative such as "SYSTEM",  "WORK", 
"MBASIC", etc.

	Never  write  on a distribution copy,...the diskette  you 
received from someone else.  If you alter such a diskette in  any 
way, you usually void any warranty. Do not add to it, delete from 
it,  or rename anything.  Do not even write a .DOC file, a volume 
serial  number,  or  anything else on it.   You should  label  it 
"DISTRIB", and make a complete fresh copy from which to work.  If 
you have to send it back for an update to the next release, or to 
get a bug fixed,  or because you can't read it anymore,  etc. you 
can not expect the people you got it from to listen to your story 
of how "..it's exactly like when you sent it to me,  except....". 
It  is  bound  to  cost you money sooner or later  if  you  alter 
distribution diskettes.

Since you will not be altering them,  you must count on  peel-off 
labels to identify your distribution diskette contents, etc. 

		A. Apply a peel-off label saying
		   "DISTRIB".

		B. Write the date received on that
		   label.

		C. Write protect the diskette.

		D. Make your working copy from which
		   you will begin tailoring.
		   Clearly label this copy.
		   I call mine "DISTCOPY".

		E. Make a 2nd copy of valuable stuff
		   for an off-site location. This
		   might be your office, or another
		   user. It should NOT be your car
		   trunk, or other outside storage.
		   Humidity will ruin your diskettes.

		F. Store the "DISTRIB" diskette with
		   other "DISTRIB" diskettes, not with
		   the working copies of that system.
		   Physically separate backup copies
		   from those you use daily.


	Now that we have secured your distribution diskette,  and 
made  a working copy,  we are ready to tackle one of the cruelest 
problems in using a computer.  Give some thought to the NAMES you 
apply to programs in the process of being changed.

	One  scheme is to add a "suffix" to the filename,  or  to 
change the filetype to .001  .002  etc.

	You  want to keep some consistency so that the names  are 
meaningful,  and wildcards can be used with utilities   (example:  
PIP  B:=C:PROGM???.BAS[V]).   But  you  must  name  your  changes 
differently  from the distribution filename,  and from your other 
changes. How will you know which is your latest version? How will 
you know which is your latest version which works?

	It  is a mistake to count on keeping the  same  filename, 
and using different diskettes.  The trend is rapidly toward large 
capacity,  non-removeable hard disks.   In a few years,  everyone 
will  have  5 or 10 MB disks!  Anyway,  it is easier to  learn  a 
disciplined approach,  and follow it,  than to spend alot of time 
making  gobs  of  filecopies and then trying to  remember  what's 
what.

	If  you begin changing a program called  BUDGET.BAS,  you 
might  call your first  modification  BUDGET01.BAS,  BUDGET1.BAS, 
BUDGET.001, BUD1.BAS, B1.BAS etc. It is a matter of taste, and of 
how large your library is.   The larger it is,  the more specific 
you have to be...you might have more than one budget program.  If 
you  have an editor,  and you save the basic program as an  ASCII 
file  (ie.  SAVE "B:BUDGET01.ASC",A),  you may want to adopt  the 
.ASC  filetype naming convention to clearly identify it as  ready 
for your editor, or to be modemed to another user.  Be aware that 
some operating systems have a limit of six character names.

	As  you  modify  programs,  add remarks in the  front  to 
indicate  the as-of date,  version,  etc.  Professional  programs 
display this information as they are read in to be executed:  for 
example,  note  how MBASIC clearly identifies it's  version/date.  
In  that  way,  the  user knows from looking at the  CRT  if  the 
correct version of the program has been loaded. Many programs are 
dependant  on  the  release/version  of  the  operating   system. 
Unfortunately,  the  program names often do not change,  but  the 
programs  are  different.  Some will not run with  new  releases. 
Peel-off  labels  will help with this  problem  also:  ie.   "1.4 
depen", etc.

	After  you have migrated to a new release/version of your 
operating system,  a new set of problems appear.  Programs  which 
used to work,  now do not. You may have to rename some of them if 
you  are  going  to  retain old  versions  (everyone  does).  For 
example, you may want to rename CLIST to CLIST15 or CLIST16 if it 
runs  on ver 1.5 or 1.6.  Then you can use CLIST for  the  latest 
version.  This  approach  requires  you to rename a  lot  of  OLD 
programs  that do not run on new releases.   I prefer this to the 
next  method because I do not mix much among different  versions. 
If I did, I would do as below.

	Another approach (please do not mix this with the  above) 
is  to  identify  the release in the name  (CL15  or  CL16),  and 
perhaps shorten the names at the same time.   But this starts you 
talking a "different language" than the documentation,  and other 
users.  You  have to translate their conversations to your naming 
scheme.  If  you  are bright and independent,  or  shorten  names 
anyway,  then this has the advantage of avoiding a lot of  donkey 
work  at  conversion time.....you rename on your working copy  of 
the DISTRIB diskette,  and then PIP them as you go along.  You do 
not have to go back and rename a dozen copies of every program.

	There  is no right or wrong way;  it is a matter of  your 
style.   Remember though,  you can't avoid the work.  It's just a 
matter of when and how you prefer to do it.   I prefer NOT to mix 
different  releases if I have a choice.   I would rather generate 
entire new diskettes for the new release.   In this way,  I  have 
complete diskettes to go back to if I want (or need) to.  No half 
this,  and  half  that.   I avoid having to flip something  on  a 
diskette  to tell it which flavor I want to run.  If you get very 
many of these "switches" on a diskette, it is a long process just 
to  find out where your beginning from!   I make specific  copies 
and  label  them  as  to options in  effect  on  that  particular 
diskette.  Saves me time and nerves.

	I hope one or two of these ideas are helpful.  Good luck.

Hi --

        UMODEM Version 2.8 is now at MC under CPM;UMODEM C.  This
version  corrects  a  reference  to  a  system-dependent variable
TIOCSSCR for Version 7 users -- this reference is for those  sys-
tems  which  have  page  mode  installed,  and by default this is
flagged out.  By setting the PAGEMODE flag to TRUE the  user  can
flag this ioctl call back in.

        Version 2.8 also supports TERM II FTP 4 now  ...  looking
good!   This  is invoked by the 4 option; FTP 4 is not present in
TERM II, Version 4.7, but it  will  be  in  Version  4.8  (to  be
released  in the near future).  No problems have been reported to
me yet concerning TERM II, and  Version  4.8  is  an  enhancement
only.

        Enjoy!

To:   info-micro at AI

Conversation today with Hewlett-Packard revealed that disk incompatibility
problem for cp/m with HP-125 is due to very rapid reading of HP disk drive.
Result is that disks written by HP-125 in "IBM format" can be read by
other cp/m systems capable of reading standard single-density cp/m disks, but
disks written by these other systems not readable by HP-125.  HP's
position on this is that they advertised the machine as cp/m compatable,
and it will be.  The HP division making the disk drives has been working
on the problem for a couple of weeks and have two solutions that work
so far.  They will pick the best one and then retrofit it to existing
units and correct new ones.  No dates given, but impression is that
fix will be available within next couple of weeks.

Subject:   UMODEM Version 2.7

Hi, Everyone,

        The latest version of UMODEM is now available  on  MIT-MC
under  CPM.  Its name is CPM;UMODEM C [I decided to keep only the
current version at MIT-MC].

        Thanks TONS to Bennett  Marks  for  his  transportability
conversion to UNIX Version 7 (his release is UMODEM Version 2.6).
I think he did a superior job!  This new UMODEM (Version 2.7)  is
an  enhancement of his upgrade.  To compile it for your UNIX sys-
tem, the following command lines are recommended:

cc -7 umodem.c -o umodem -DJHU  <-- for JHU UNIX
cc -7 umodem.c -o umodem -DVER7 <-- for Version 7 UNIX (I'm not sure -7 is
                                        required)

        Version 2.7 includes the Version 7 UNIX transportability,
a  status  option  (y)  which  gives  the user file size and CP/M
record count information for his up/down loading  time  estimate,
and  a  7-bit  transmission option (7) which masks out the MSB of
either protocol (TERM II FTP 1 or FTP 3 [CP/M  UG  Protocol])  so
that  a  modified MODEM2 or TERM II can transceive text files via
UMODEM on the ARPA Net.  The ARPA Net problems (bah, humbug!) are
still not resolved, but I'm working on them.

        Enjoy, and thanks for all the interest!

Re:   CHEAP FORTRAN AND MACRO 80 PROGRAMS

If you want a copy of the Microsoft F80 and M80 programs
as well as their support software and you want to get them
with free updates for a year and be a legal user read on.
While not free, Heathkit sells these programs, doctored up
so they only run on Heath systems, at a discount.  The
discount is quite steep and the free updates are attractive.
You will need to know about DDT and SAVE to fix them so you
can use them:

FOR FORTRAN: >DDT F80.COM
then alter the LXI d,barf at 2C38 to jmp 2C90.
Exit from DDT and do a SAVE 107 F80.COM

FOR MACRO80: >DDT M80.COM
then alter the LXI d,barf at 4392 to jmp 43EA.
Exit from DDT and do a SAVE 75 M80.COM

You now own legal copies of both programs suitable for use
on your CP/M 1.4 or 2.2 system.

This patch bypasses the vendor code check in the CP/M
serial number and also bypasses some I/O twitching that
must be important for Heath systems.  The other system
programs distibuted on the disk do not need patching
these programs (LIB, L80 XREF etc) assume if you got to
use them you must be ok.

The same patch is probably possible in other Heath
software such as BASIC Compiler or COBOL Compiler.  I
have not researched these programs however.

My advice to fix other software would be to look at the
area in which the vendor code check is being carried out
and follow the same bypass as I did in M80.

Lots of Luck - Happy Computing from us at NSI.

Re:   TYPESQ version 1.3 now available

TYPESQ version 1.2 (previously called TYPESQ2), the program for typing
"squeezed" ASCII files, has been updated as of today (thanks to Bob
Mathias).  TYPESQ2 was printing CR-CR-LF when it came to a CR-LF in
the file.  This has been corrected, and a message has been added to
the 40 and 80 character limited versions to tell when the limit has
been exceeded.  The previous versions simply stopped printing.

New version 1.3 .COM files:

--> FILE:  TYPSQ40A.COM		CRC = 5B A9	<--limit 40 lines

--> FILE:  TYPSQ80A.COM		CRC = 3B 10	<--limit 80 lines

--> FILE:  TYPESQ13.COM		CRC = 52 C5


Source code for new version 1.3:

--> FILE:  TYPESQ13.C  		CRC = D1 9C

--> FILE:  SPCLDIO .C  		CRC = C5 DC



	  TYPESQ.DOC as of 7/6/81
   by Bob Mathias and Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

TYPESQ.COM is a program primarily for use on remote
CP/M systems to allow typing "squeezed" files.  It
does not accept wild cards, but will accept multiple
file names on the command line, separated by spaces.
The output to the console is "filtered" (like MLIST)
to eliminate control characters other than CR, LF,
TAB, or FORMFEED.

TYPESQ is based on USQ by Richard Greenlaw, and was
written by Bob Mathias, with suggestions from Keith
Petersen.

for the parallel I/O ports:

1.  Number of handshake lines per I/O port
2.  Extent of software control
3.  Strobe lines:  is strobe pulse under complete software control,
    as far as pulse width, or does the board just generate a short
    pulse internally every time a strobe is requested, etc.
4.  Attention line:  selectable polarity, choice of detecting
    transition of line (i.e. edge sensing) or simply a the level
    of the line (i.e. level sensing).  Hopefully, both are available.
5.  Auxillary Sensing lines, etc.

If this board is not flexible, does onyone have other suggestions
as to an I/O board which is?

The latest, and significantly improved version of FMAP.COM is now
available in MC:AR1:CPM;FMAP COM .

Several new options are now available with this FMAP, in particular,
M, D, P, and the S sub-option.  All create a NAMES.SUB file as with
the old version.  The S sub-option, combined with any of the others,
offers each file for consideration.  The other three create entries
for each file with various forms and placement of $n args: M suitable
for use with MODEM, D for general purpose, and P for PIP... The Unnn
option creates -CATALOG.nnn instead of NAMES.SUB .

Subject:   UMODEM Version 2.5

Hi, Everyone,

        The version of UMODEM on MIT-MC is 2.5 --  two  things  I
should clarify about it:

        1.  It is written to run under UNIX Version  6.12x  (JHU-
UNIX, specifically).  To convert to some other UNIX (say, Version
7), the system-dependent features  are  referenced  in  comments.
JHU-UNIX-specific  references are made, and system-dependent con-
stants are noted by SD in a comment with  them.   Also,  UMODEM.C
was compiled with the Version 7 option on the UNIX C compiler.

        2.  The ARPA Net interface isn't sound yet.  This is  en-
gaged with the 'a' option (see the internal documentation).  Some
TIPs don't configure themselves correctly and I believe there  is
still  some problem with the commands I issue to SERVER TELNET in
general.  Any help from an ARPA Net hacker on these matters would
be  greatly  appreciated.   I  am  using the WILL, WONT, IAC, DO,
DONT, etc, stuff, but I  don't  think  I'm  using  it  completely
correctly; also, the 'a' option traps out IAC references (FF Hex)
by doubling them, so I caught that problem.  Thanks  specifically
to GZ for her help in such matters.

        Any help with the ARPA Net interface would be greatly ap-
preciated.

 On the old Imsai mainframes, the power switch was placed on the front
panel.  In many systems, the noise from having 110vac running alongside
logic levels was too much (randomly); I know of several systems in which
the user moved the switch *off* of the front panel for this reason.
 I'm not sure of the N* setup, this is just a possible cause of trouble

I purchased a N* Horizon with dual drives and quad disks in December
80.  Has anyone tried paralleling the Pwr and Reset switches to the
front panel or even moving them physically from the rear panel to the
front.  They are heck to get to in standard computer furniture.

Also, I made an extension cable for the baud rate header with an
8-positon DIP switch wired direct to cable which works just fine.
This gives me 4 baud rates for each of the 2 serial ports.  Then I
made another cable with the switch pluggable to the cable via two
wire-wrap sockets.  I cannot get it to work altho it checks out
perfectly with a continuity checker.  Has anyone had any experience
with such an animal.  I've tried both a short (10") and a long (24")
cable, and neither work -- my original cable was about 18".  I've
swapped switches and cables -- I've done everything but rewire the
sockets, which is my last resort.  Any ideas?

This cable is extremely handy if one is switching rt. & left ports,
devices, modems, or whatever -- saves pulling off the case and
inserting a new header each time.

Subject: Static RAM info

The following is forwarded from my RCPM system:

STAT-RAM.DOC:  Prices and Capabilities of Recent S-100 Static RAM Boards

                              Ben Bronson, HP/RCPM
                              312-955-4493, 8/5/81

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talking  with one of the people at a local computer store the  other  day 
made me realize that many, including professionals, have not been keeping 
track of the recent dramatic increases in static RAM capabilities and the 
equally dramatic drops in prices.  

Most  of us are used to paying about $300 for an assembled and tested  S-
100  l6k static board.   While traditional prices for dynamic RAM  boards 
have not been a lot less in 16K configurations, we are also accustomed to 
a 2:1 price advantage of dynamic over static in 32K and larger configura
tions.

Now,  no  one disputes that static RAMs are a lot less temperamental when 
it comes time to put a new board into a computer and boot the machine up.  
Statics have many fewer timing problems,  and tend to run faster,  hotter 
and, some think, more reliably.  These advantages have made many computer 
users willing to pay the 2:1 premium for static rather than dynamic  RAM.  
Altough  they have generally believed that dynamic RAMs were the wave  of 
the future, they have gone on buying static and waiting.

But  the situation now seems to have taken an unexpected  twist.   Almost 
unnoticed  by  many  experts,  statics are undergoing a  strong  revival, 
especially in the S-100 field.  The market has suddenly been flooded with 
offerings of new,  ultra-high capacity static boards which are (1) relat-
ively cheap,  (2) compatible with almost all processors and disk control-
lers, and (3) very fast indeed.

Static  boards  now run at twice the speed of any  dynamic  board.   Many 
static brands are fully compatible with the new IEEE S-100 standard; even 
the most recent and expensive dynamic brands rarely are.   And the  price 
differential  has  declined so far that one can often find static  boards 
that are actually cheaper than equivalent dynamic boards.

This  situation is not reflected in the inventory of the average  dealer, 
who  still may have boxes full of memory boards bought last year and  who 
may not have made recent price comparisons anyway.   The following  table 
is  therefore  offered  as a aid to both dealers and their  customers  in 
deciding what to stock, recommend, and/or buy.   This writer's feeling is 
that  the  table  gives good reasons for insisting on  recent  models  of 
static  memory boards in all cases except when the main consideration  is 
to have massive amounts of memory (128k, 254k or 512k) on a single board.  
Static  boards of 1979-1980 vintage,  with 16k at @ $300,  should not  be 
bought.   Famous-name dynamic boards offered at similar prices should  be 
laughed off the market.

The  data  in the table was extracted from advertisements in  the  August 
1981  issue of Byte.   Omissions should generally be interpreted as nega-
tives or as specs the manufacturer is not proud of.   Positive statements 
about included features should of course be taken with a grain of salt.

To: INFO-CPM at MIT-ML
I am in the process of writing a line printer spooler for an H89 on
CP/M 2.2.  Everything has been working perfectly UNTIL one situation
occurs.  If I am performing some task that requires a disk operation
and a disk head is loaded when the spooler attempts to read from
a disk simultaneously, the system crashes.

I have gone so far as to save the old DMA value before I move it around
with the spooler.  Thus, that is NOT the problem.  Does anybody have
any ideas on how to avoid the problem.  I suppose that if some status
bit somewhere indicated that a disk operation was occuring I could
cause the spooler to wait.  But, since I am using interrupts, I am not
sure that I could actually have the spooler return to the old process
until that process had finished with the disk.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I could handle this problem?

Thanks,

	CCS has a very complete cp/m 2.2, with some extra goodies
thrown in.  There is a relocatable CBIOS (they supply GENMOD.COM on
the distribution disk.)  You are allowed to mix and match floppy
drives (8" and 5.25".)  They have some /good/ documentation.

	However, you absolutely must have a z-80 cpu to use their
controller (the firmware supplied with the CCS controller has z-80
code,) prefferably CCS' z-80 board, since their software comes already
set up for it.  We recently bought the controller board, and now
have the CPU on order.  C'est la vie.

Several people recently mentioned CCS hardware.  Any comments on their
board set (CPU, floppy controller, 64k dynamic, 4-serial)?  Is their
CP/M that comes with the FDC a reasonable implementation?

Also, the above system needs to run WordStar to a terminal.  Is there
a better choice at the price than a VT-100?

Dan,

        Thanks for the note ... thanks also to Keith Petersen for
his  follow-on note.  Because I am using older 2MHz memory boards
in my Intersystems, I have never tried running the Morrow Designs
Rev  B  and Ithaca MPU at 4MHz.  What you two have proposed could
very well be the answer; I often thought that it was funny that I
could  bring up CP/M 1.4 but NOT CP/M 2.2.  By the way, the Cali-
fornia Computer Systems MPU card and Morrow  Designs  Rev  B  are
running together at 2MHz also.

I hacked the code generator for Cain's C one night so it

I wrote a MP/M,CP/M, LDRBIOS that talks to a N* and SD

doesn't do any smart buffering, but it was fine for copying
my 45 N* disks a few 2S2D 8in disks.  If somebody is interested
I can transfer it to CMUC where they can snarf it.  I will

I have noticed a lot of chatter about Ithaca Intersystems

I have worked with a lot of their stuff and recently installed
two pds-80 (systems with pascal/z etc.) I must admit, the 'cache bios'
works!1  Wwith an extra 64K of extended memory, the interrupt
driven bios supports read-after-read, read-after-write, and
automatic background memory tests when the system is otherwise
idling.  I am now very curious t see their z8000 coherenet

Hi, Lauren,

        The documentation on the Ithaca Z80 card I am use  CLAIMS
to  be fully compatable with the IEEE S-100 standard.  The 20 ad-
dress bits (1M byte addressing) is what is supported by this card
directly,  and it simply lets the high-order 4 bits go low (actu-
ally claims to force them low).

        I have used this processor with a number of different  S-
100  boards  from  different  manufacturers  and have had no real
trouble.  About the only board I couldn't get it to work with was
the  Morrow Designs 8" disk controller (both Rev A and B) running
CP/M 2.2 with the Morrow Designs' BIOS (strangely, this runs fine
with  CP/M 1.4 with the Morrow Designs' BIOS); I don't place much
emphasis on this problem,  because  I  have  tried  these  Morrow
Designs  disk controllers with a number of Z80 CPU cards and have
found CP/M 2.2 to work well with the California Computer  Systems
Z80  card  only  (Ithaca Z80, Vector Graphic Z80, and a couple of
others were tried).  Morrow Designs CP/M 2.2 seems to  work  well
with all the 8080 CPU cards I've tried, however.

Subject:   Re:  hard/soft sectored floppy formats

Alan,

        I have been faced with a similar problem before, and have
come  up  with  a software-based alternative which seems to solve
the problem.  In my particular environment, I have the capability
of  transferring  the  files  on  hard-sectored North Star 5 1/4"
single-density disks to  soft-sectored  8"  single-density  (CP/M
standard) and double-density disks.

        Now for the bad news ... I'm using two microcomputer sys-
tems  to  do  this.  They are linked by a 9600-baud RS-232 serial
communications  channel,  and  I  am  running  my   commercially-
available  TERM II/XTERM programs to do the transfer.  You can do
a similar thing with the public domain MODEM2/XMODEM programs  or
other programs which support a file transfer facility.

        This environment can be pictured as follows:

CRT <---> TERM II or MODEM2 Microcomputer <--> XTERM or XMODEM
          with 8" disks                         Microcomputer
                                                with 5 1/4" disks

        The steps for transferring a file are as follows:

                1.  Turn on both computers and boot  up  CP/M  on
each.   The 9600-baud serial link to the TERM II microcomputer is
the default console for the XTERM microcomputer.

                2.  Run TERM II and select the modem going to the
desired  XTERM  microcomputer.  Link to this and communicate with
it in terminal (transparent) mode; from this mode, you can  issue
normal CP/M commands as though you were directly connected to the
XTERM microcomputer.

                3.  Run XTERM and specify the file  you  want  to
work with (file name as it exists or is to exist on the XTERM mi-
crocomputer) and whether you want to send it from XTERM  to  TERM
II or receive it on the XTERM system from the TERM II system.

                4.  Return to TERM II, specify the file name  for
the  TERM  II  system (may be different from the XTERM name), and
specify to TERM II whether it is to receive (XTERM is sending) or
send  (XTERM is receiving) the file.  At this point, the two sys-
tems will synchronize and transfer the file data  with  automatic
error detection and retry (in packets) between them.

        If  you  have  two  such  systems  with  the  appropriate
software  (CP/M  and  a communications package), you can transfer
between virtually any two disk formats you  desire  provided  you
have  the  controller hardware to support the desired formats.  I
hope this helps.

David,

        I have not seen the flyer you refer to, but I DO  own  an
Ithaca  Intersystems DPS-1 mainframe.  I feel that this is an ex-
cellent supporting mainframe whose outstanding features include:

                . 20 slot terminated IEEE S-100 motherboard
                . large, reliable power supply (8V at 30A)
                . full front panel with the following features:
                        - memory examine/examine next
                        - memory deposit/deposit next
                        - instruction CYCLE single step
			- instruction CYCLE slow step
			  (adjustable speed)
                        - hardware breakpoint when a
                          specified data byte encountered
                        - hardware breakpoint when a

                        - run/stop
                        - many test points for hardware debugging
                . Ithaca Z80 CPU Card:
                        - supports 20-bit (1M byte) addressing
                          [IEEE S-100 supports 24 bits (16M byte)]
                        - full on-board interrupt controller
                        - many options for configuring processor
                          for specific applications
                        - full DMA is supported

        The features you described in your message,  namely  disk
blocking and deblocking and interrupt-driven I/O, can be support-
ed by this hardware, but they must be  implemented  in  the  CP/M
BIOS  software.   I  am  quite  pleased with the hardware and its
quality of design, but I do not run their CP/M on my  system  and
do not have these more exotic features implemented.

A similar question to the one put forth by RAMAG -- well, sortof.

I'd like to know how system/directory tracks are set up in CP/M for
nonstandard disk sizes and formats.

For example, standard CP/M on an 8inch disk:

tracks 0,1 --- system
track 2: blocks 0 and 1 (1024 byte blocks) --- directory

Now, what about other systems?  How about double density 8 inch?
Single and double density 5 1/4 inch?  Northstar?  H89 5 1/4?
Apple with Softcard?  TRS-80?  What happens with odd sector sizes?
Are 1024 byte blocks always used internally by CP/M?

And what ARE the differences between regular CP/M and CP/M running on 
the softcard?

Does anyone have a table or document (or just KNOW) how to translate
(software-wise) between these various system and disk formats?

Thanks.

I have an application where I need to translate disks from different
soft-sectored and hard-sectored floppy disk formats to standard cp/m.
There was a controller advertised in BYTE that claimed to be able to
do this: the Omega controller by Sirius Systems of Knoxville, TN.
Unfortunately, their phone is disconnected, so they probably ceased.
(They don't answer letters either!)

TI has announced a new generalized controller chip that should
do the job, but it's too new to be in a product yet.

Does anyone know of any other product or approach that might work?
As a last resort, I might have to commission a custom design using the TTI
chip, but I would by far rather deal with a standard S-100 product.
If I can't do it with one general-purpose controller, then I would use
a separate controller for the hard-sectored formats--but I haven't seen
an s-100 board for controlling only hard-sectored floppies either.

Hope someone can help!

Check your copies with CRCK.  The files with a "Q" as the
middle letter of the filetype are squeezed versions of the
originals.  You don't need these to compile - you need the
un-squeezed versions.  To save disk space and modeming time,
some systems may offer only the squeezed versions.  You can
restore those by running USQ on them.

Please note that SQDIO and USQDIO are not supplied because
they are identical to DIO2 and can be created with PIP.

File CPM;XMODEM SAI is an adaptation of W8SDZ's  XMODEM 4.3.   It is written
in SAIL and should be easily (?) adaptable to TENEX & TOPS-20 sites.  The
currrent version only allows down-loading (S) of text and COM files.  Up-
loading (R) will be added later on.

If somebody adapts it to TENEX (or has one available) please let me know.

Subject: New version of TYPESQ
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

TYPESQ.COM, the program for typing "squeezed" ASCII files,
has been updated as of today (thanks to RJM@MC).  The original
version of TYPESQ.COM did not stop when it came to the first 1Ah
in the last sector of the file.  If the file was not filled to
the end with 1A's, it would print whatever "garbage" was left
in that sector.  The new version corrects this.

Also available for RCPM operators are two other versions of
the new TYPESQ, one which limits the maximum number of lines
that can be typed to 40, the other to 80.  This is to discourage
RCPM users from spending too much time on the system typing
long files, thus denying others the use of the system.  These
limited versions tell the user to please use XMODEM for full
transfers.  (Reasoning: typing a file takes much longer than
XMODEMing it because the TABs are expanded).

The new files are on MC
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ 40COM
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ 80COM
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ ALLCOM

No source code is available at this time.  Watch for
announcement later.

Sender: William.Sholar at CMU-10A
Message-Id: <21Jul81 220101 WS70@CMU-10A>


	Since the documentation on the Mod 2 TRS-80 does not bother
to discuss hardware, the following port addresses and equates for
MODEM.ASM programs might prove useful to anyone using this machine:

	MODCTLP	EQU	0F6H	;status/control port A
	MODSNDB	EQU	04H	;bit 2 indicates ready to send
	MODSNDR	EQU	04H	;  with the bit set to 1
	MODRCVB	EQU	01H	;bit 0 indicates character received
	MODRCVR	EQU	01H	;  with the bit set to 1
	MODDATP	EQU	0F4H	;data port A

	These values, plugged into MODEM.ASM, allow the TRS-80 Mod 2 to
function without any special system calls or other variations from the
existing MODEM.ASM program, assuming the port has been set up using the
SETUP (Pickles & Trout's CPM), CONFIG (Lifeboat's CPM) or SET (Cybernetics'
CPM) utility for the appropriate baud rate, etc.

I received the following file on my remote CP/M system yesterday
and thought all here would find it of interest.

	    OSBORNE.DOC   -   FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
	       OF THE OSBORNE I MICROCOMPUTER

by:   Steven C. Rich
      Computer Connection
      Farmington Hills, Michigan 
      (313) 477-4470

	  --------------------------------------------

     The wait is finally over!	We  received our  demonstra-
tion unit of the Osborne I  Microcomputer last Monday,	July 
13.  I have just spent the past several days going over this 
unit, and thought you might find my first impressions inter-
esting.

     First  some technical information at random.  Note that 
this  is  an initial production unit.	There  may  be	many   
changes before units get in customer hands. Yes, all digital 
electronics are on one board!  (and quite a good looking one 
at  that!).  Only the boards for the drives and the  monitor 
electronics are seperate.    Memory appears to use 4116 type 
chips.	The CPU looks like the Japaneese NEC Z-80 Copy!  The 
drives	are  10 Soft Sector with Standard capacity of  102K.  
This  is supposed to be expandable through a double  density 
option.  The  ones in the unit we have are made by  Seimans.  
All  we have received in the way of software is a very	bare 
version of CP/M ( SYSGEN,  COPY,  PIP,	and FORMAT,  but  no 
Assembler or DDT ),  and Microsoft Basic-80.  Both appear to 
work  beautifully on the Osborne.   The caliber of the	CP/M 
utilities  sent is excellent (the FORMAT program  automatic-
ally checks the media for example!).  One interesting bit of 
information  is  that there is apparently a Real Time  clock 
function for DATE and TIME which will be set through a SETUP 
program.  The Microsoft manual, by the way, is a copy of the 
Standard  Basic 80 one,  but is fully typeset and thus	much 
more readable.

     OK.  Time for first impressions.	Taken in the context 
of an economical and complete way to get into computing (and 
CP/M  software in particular) it is a great machine.   It is 
true  that  you may not be able to expand  the	machine  for 
ever,  but how many of us have been able to afford to create 
our  "dream  machines".   Ever	try to talk YOUR  wife	into 
agreeing to let you spend $6,000 for a hard disk (but I just 
HAVE  to have it!).   The 52 character format of the  screen 
may might seen hard to get used to,  but it is a window on a 
larger	128 X 36 character screen.  By pressing the  Control 
key  and  one of the arrow keys,  you INSTANTLY  scroll  the 
screen.  I cannot praise the speed of the scroll enough.  It 
is  extremely  smooth  and  fast,  and	will  overcome	many 
objections  of	the screen format.  And if you	truly  can't  
stand  the  small  screen and don't like  the  9"  ($250.00) 
monitor,  then just connect a "Professional" terminal to the 
RS-232 port,  reassign the CON:  to the port and off you  go 
with a full 80 characters!

     I	am going to reserve final judgement until I see  the 
rest of the software.	But, from what I have seen so far, I 
feel that Mr.  Osborne has done just what he started out  to 
do  - Place a full function CP/M business system within  the 
reach of anyone and made it portable to boot!

     More information will follow shortly.   Please call  me 
if you want more info.

Subject: CPM eats control chars going to listing device?
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC, INFO-MICRO at MIT-MC


Recently I have become endowed with a CPM system of strange
origins. It has a version of CPM by some group called Teletek.
Since it has a nice EPSOM printer hanging off of it,
myself and a friend have become intersted in doing
intersting things with the printer(like boldface,widetype etc)
via assembly language hacking.

Apparently as far as we can tell CPM eats control characters
going to the 'list device'. Is this normal for CPM? If so
is there anyway to turn it off,so that one can just send
any character one wants to the printer. Does anyone know
where in memory the i/o routines usually lurk???

Thanks Muchly,
Have fun

Subject:  Multi-user, etc., revisited
To: INFO-MICRO at MIT-MC, INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

In the last few months it seems a number of multi-user systems have
come out of the woodwork and are demanding our attention.  My office
has been investigating several systems and are aware of several
others, mainly through advertising in the various trade magazines.

What we'd like to do is build up a better base of information on the
schemes available and of those, which ones actually exist, in use at a
customer's site - not a prototype.

I would like to hear first-, and possibly, second-hand information in
those two catagories: what is actually available, and of those,
end-user descriptions of the system features and failings.

The major criteria is that the system must provide an environment
capable of running any program designed to run under CP/M 1.4 or 2.2
with a shared hard disk and be capable of spooling output to at least
one shared printer.

We are already aware of and in the process of evaluating Micro-Mike's
JOESHARE, and Action Computer Enteprise's DPC/OS and MuSYS's MuDOS.
We are only aware of OSM's ZEUS system and Micromation's M/NET from
seeing them demonstrated at the West Coast Computer Faire.

Since then we have come across many others apparently capable of
handling the basic requirement (with the secondary advantage of being
able to share files as well - currently a limitation of the Micro-Mike
system).

Again, we would like to hear from end-users of any of these systems
with mail addressed directly to FJW@MC - and NOT to these lists.  I
will consolidate the replies and send out a pointer later.

Thanks,
Frank

To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

		      SQUSQFLS.DOC
	Documentation for FLS, SQ, USQ, and TYPESQ

---------------------------------------------------------------

FLS.COM

 The purpose of this program is to build parameter lists
 for programs such as the SQ and USQ file compression
 utilities. This and those programs use the directed io
 package to allow redirection of console input and/or output.
 They are coded to accept parameters from the console input or
 from the command line. Each parameter is on a seperate line.

 Names beginning with '-' are passed through as options.

 Drive names (with ':') alone are also passed through.

 Other parameters are treated as ambiguous file names with
 optional drive specification. The disk directory is searched
 and every specific file name which matches the pattern is
 sent to the output list (with the optional drive specifier).
 If there are no matches a comment is sent to the console.

 Example test run (output to console):
      A>fls.c c:*.com b:.h

 Example to build list in "file":
      A>fls.c c:*.com b:.h >file

 Example to build list in file and send to console too:
      A>fls.c c:*.com b:.h +file

 Example to build list and run program SQ.COM with list
 substituting for keyboard input:
      A>fls b:.c d:*.?Q? |sq

---------------------------------------------------------------

SQ.COM

 This program compresses a file without loosing information.
 The usq.com program is required to unsqueeze the file
 before it can be used.

 Typical compression rates are:
      .COM    6%      (Don't bother)
      .ASM    33%     (using full ASCII set)
      .DIC    46%     (using only uppercase and a few others)

 Squeezing a really big file takes a few minutes.

 Useage:

      SQ item ...

 where ... represents more (optional) items and "item" is
 either:

      drive:	      to change the output drive

      file	      input file

      drive:file      input file


 If no such items are given on the command line you will be
 prompted for commands (one at a time). An empty command
 terminates the program.

 SQ uses the dio package, so input and output can be redirected
 by special items on the command line such as:

      <file	      reads console input from file

      >file	      sends console output to file

      +file	      sends console output to console and file


 Also console output of another program using dio can be piped
 to the input of this one or vice-versa. Example:

      A>fls parameters |sq


 where fls might be a program that expands patterns like.com to
 a list of ambiguous file names for sq to squeeze.

 The squeezed file name is formed by changing the second letter
 of the file type to Q. If there is no file type, the squeezed
 file type is QQQ. If the name exists it is overwritten!

 Examples:

      A>SQ GRUMP	      makes GRUMP.QQQ on A:

      A>SQ D:CRAP.XYZ	      makes CRAP.XQZ on A:

      A>SQ B: D:CRAP.COM      makes CRAP.CQM on B:

      B>SQ X.A C: Y.B	      makes X.AQ on B: and Y.BQ on C:


 The transformations compress strings of identical bytes and
 then encode each resulting byte value and EOF as bit strings
 having lengths in inverse proportion to their frequency of
 occurrance in the intermediate input stream.  The latter uses
 the Huffman algorithm.	 Decoding information is included in
 the squeezed file, so squeezing short files or files with
 uniformly distributed byte values will actually increase size.

---------------------------------------------------------------

USQ.COM

 Program to unsqueeze files formed by sq.com.

 Useage:

      USQ item ...

 where ... represents more (optional) items and "item" is
 either:

      drive:	      to change the output drive

      file	      input file

      drive:file      input file


 If no such items are given on the command line you will be
 prompted for commands (one at a time). An empty command
 terminates the program.

 USQ uses the dio package, so input and output can be redirec-
 ted by special items on the command line such as:

      <file	      reads console input from file

      >file	      sends console output to file

      +file	      sends console output to console and file


 Also console output of another program usinf dio can be piped
 to the input of USQ or vice-versa. Example:

      A>fls parameters |usq

 where fls might be a program that expands patterns like.asm to
 a list of specific file names for usq to unsqueeze.

 The unsqueezed file name is recorded in the squeezed file.

 Examples:

      A>USQ GRUMP.QQQ	      writes on a:

      A>USQ D:CRAP.XQZ	      writes on A:

      A>USQ B: D:CRAP.CQM     writes on B:

      B>USQ X.AQ C: Y.BQ      writes X.?? on B: and Y.?? on C:

---------------------------------------------------------------

TYPESQ.COM

 Program to print squeeze files formed by sq.com.

	  TYPESQ.DOC as of 7/6/81
   by Bob Mathias and Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

TYPESQ.COM is a program primarily for use on remote
CP/M systems to allow typing "squeezed" files.  It
does not accept wild cards, but will accept multiple
file names on the command line, separated by spaces.
The output to the console is "filtered" (like MLIST)
to eliminate control characters other than CR, LF,
TAB, or FORMFEED.

The source code file TYPESQ.C is compiled the same
way as USQ.  See SQBUILD.DOC for instructions.

TYPESQ is based on USQ by Richard Greenlaw, and was
written by Bob Mathias, with suggestions from Keith
Petersen.

The .COM and .DOC files are available on MC as:
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ COM   and  AR3:CPM;TYPESQ DOC
The source code is there too: AR3:CPM;TYPESQ C

Sure is nice to be able to squeeze all the big ASM and DOC
files on my remote CP/M system!  I freed up 600k on the hard
disk.  The average reduction is 35-40 percent, depending upon
the makeup of the file.  The reduction may be even greater if
the file contains a lot of spaces.

All leftover source files in MC:CPM; have been moved to AR6:CPM; .
All Remote CP/M source and related files (like BYE and USER88, for
building up a dialin configuration) have been moved to AR7:CPM;.  (The
lists of phone numbers for the BBS's and RCP/M's remain where they
are.)

MC:CPM;-CPM- INDEX now contains a writeup on this archive scheme
similar to my first file reorganization message.  The remainder of
that file will be updated as time permits to correspond to the actual
files available and where they are.

With the considerable space savings gained by moving files into the

been moved to backup tape to online status in some ARn: in MC:CPM;.

The above patch MAY work, but it depends on what address your cpm 
runs at. Try instead the following:

     S125F
      125F 5F AF        (SAME AS ABOVE)
      1260 ?? .

     S12C0 CD 18        (PUT IN A RELATIVE JUMP)
      12C1 ?? 01
      12C2 ?? 00        (THIS DOESN'T MATTER)
      12C3 06 06        (DON'T CHANGE)
      12C4 06 01
      12C5 ?? .

     S12E1 
      12E1 CD 18	(ANOTHER RELATIVE JUMP)
      12E2 ?? 04
      12E3 ?? ??
      12E4 CD 18	(YET ANOTHER RELATIVE JUMP)
      12E5 ?? 01
      12E6 ?? .

When ZSID relocates itself an offset is added to bytes 12c2, 12e3, and
12e6. The previous patch left this offset to be interpreted as an opcode.
The result can be benign or disastrous depending on the size of your 
cpm.

   SQ/USQ/FLS file update notice - 6/27/81
	 by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

This is a list of CRCs for the latest SQ/USQ/FLS files,
obtained from Richard Greenlaw (the author) on 6/27/81.

The author recently updated some of the programs, which will
require replacement of many of the previously-released files,
including SQ.COM, USQ.COM and FLS.COM.

Check your copies with CRCK.  The files with a "Q" as the
middle letter of the filetype are squeezed versions of the
originals.  You don't need these to compile - you need the
un-squeezed versions.  To save disk space and modeming time,
some systems may offer only the squeezed versions.  You can
restore those by running USQ on them.

Please note that SQDIO and USQDIO are not supplied because
they are identical to DIO2 and can be created with PIP.

Most of the files in MC:CPM; have been moved to an "archive" device.
The simplified expanation of this mechanism is to consider the archive
devices as "subdirectories".  Normally, there is an implied device,
DSK:, asssociated with each file.  With a file in an archive device,
you must explicitly name the archive device, ARn:.  Other than that,
you can reference the files as you normally do.

These archive devices show up in the normal directory listing as:

MC:CPM;
  1   AR0    DOCFIL  32 +440  - All doc and misc files
  14  AR1    COMFIL  23 +604  - All COM files
  14  AR2    HLPFIL  26 +674  - All HLP files
  0   AR3    SQ/USQ  12 +222  - All sources to SQ/USQ/FLS
  1   AR4    APPLE   28 +875  - All APPLE/Z80 files (mostly MODEM)

Each of these, in turn have their own directory listings for the
individual files.  (Use :FIND AR1:CPM;  to list all of the COM files.)

For example, to reference the HELP COM file, use AR1:CPM;HELP COM .

If you have any problems with this, please send a note to

Subject: MOV E,0/MOV E,B
To:   info-cpm at MC

Hi, All,

        A question was raised recently as to why the  assembler  would
interpret MOV E,0 as MOV E,B, and I thought I'd transmit my answer for
general interest.  Response follows.

        Re  your  question as to why the assembler would interpret MOV
E,0 as MOV E,B, the assembler maintains an internal symbol  table  for
the  registers  in  which  B  is  equated  to 0, C to 1, etc.  The MOV
instruction appears in binary as:

                0 1 D D D S S S

where DDD are three bits representing  the  destination  and  SSS  are
three  bits  representing  the  source.  When the assembler puts these
instructions (MOV) together, a common technique  is  to  look  up  the
register   names   in   a   register  symbol  table  and  place  their
corresponding values into the proper fields within the binary  of  the
instruction.  For instance,

                MOV A,B -> 01 111 000 (A=7, B=0)

The instruction MOV 7,0 would generate the same effect (bit pattern).

        From my experience, all the 8080 assembler's I have used (ASM,
ASM2, MAC, and M80) use a technique similar to this.  Consequently, it
is possible to make a mistake like MOV A,0 when you wanted to load a 0
into A and the assembler would not catch it as a syntax error.

        Following are some further examples.

This may have been attempted before, but I thought it sufficiently
interesting to report to everyone...

This evening, Term Kovattana and I succeeded in using the MODEM2 program
for reliably transferring files between CP/M systems over an RS-232 link
at 9600 baud.  The two systems were an S-100 system (Cromemco Z2-D)
with 8 inch floppy disks and a HeathKit H89 with 5 inch floppy disks.
We used the latest version, [mc]cpm;modem206 asm, modified as appropriate
for the corresponding serial ports.  This program transmits binary
files in packets consisting of a header, sequence number, data, and
a checksum, and provides a simple ack/nak/timeout protocol.  We used
the "quiet" mode at each end of the connection to avoid problems caused
by program status messages garbaging the transmission.  It is a real
pleasure to see a 10K file zipping between systems in seconds!

Incidentally, the initial download from the Z2 to the H89 was accomplished
using standard CP/M tools as follows:

	Z2 end                          H89 end

pip crt:=ftp89.hex              pip ftp89.hx=rdr:[b]
pip crt:=con:
   ctl-S  ctl-Z                 ; file at this end is flushed
pip crt:=eof:                   ; file at this end is closed
				ren ftp89.hex=ftp89.hx

The [b] switch causes the receiving end to buffer the 10K hex file
in memory until the ctl-S is received as a result of the second command
line at the sending end.  Finally, the third command line transmits
a ctl-Z which causes the receiving end to close its file.  The '.hx'
file extension is used to prevent the receiving PIP from wasting time
verifying Intel Hex format while reading the file, and is subsequently
renamed to '.hex'.

Next step...attempt to transfer files between a TOPS-20 and a CP/M
system over a hard line at 9600 baud.

Re your patch, on the 6th line down (or so) from the "patch1" label,
shouldn't the instruction be "mvi e,0" rather than "mov e,0"?  The
"mov e,0" would be equivalent to "mov e,b" by the assembler, generate
no error, and work only if the B reg happened to contain 0.

re: request for info on Godbout z80 cpu in imsai 8080
Well, that is very close to what i am doing.  I have been using a cromemco
z80 cpu (ZPU) in my imsai with a Thinker Toys Discus/2D disc controller.
Wishing to run MP/M I decided to upgrade to dma disc board.  Desiring
the minimum of problems i decided to buy the disc board and a new cpu
card from the SAME company.
I am very disappointed with the software support from Godbout. The
disc board came with a BIOS listing written for them by SORCIM.
(They are the guys who did the PASCAL/M p-code compiler).  Well, the
bios was written in their own funny assembler, so they 'hand-recoded'
all the macros to be compatible with cp/m asm. needless to say, the bios
is really junky and not easy to read.  Rather than key in all 15 pages of
it, I sprang for $45 and mailed my EXISTING CP/M disc back to Godbout
They claim they will integrate their bios into my new cp/m, give me movcpm, etc.
and save me from ordering another cp/m at $150.
(What they really do, is lift my serial number, brun a new cp/m, and
trash the disc i sent in.)
Let me add that a long time ago i had problems running
the CROMEMCO ZPU at 4 meg.  My solution was to rip out the imsai motherboard
and install a Thinker Toys 'Wunderbuss' 20 slot terminated motherboard.
If you are using the imsai mother, yu may have problems with the godbout or any
other board at 4 meg.
The software with cp/m should arrive this week, will let you know what happens.

Subject: poll
To: info-cpm at ai

It has been proposed that a new list be started to continue the
(now practically invisible) discussion about CP/M vs. UNIX.
I consider this to be a rather useless exercise, since the discussion
has been dying out under its own weight in any case.  I also feel
that further fragmentation of lists is to be avoided whenever possible.

Whenever there is a flash flood of messages on a given topic, there
seems to be an immediate call from a vocal minority to START A NEW LIST.
Of course, the topic usually dies out pretty quickly, and we are left
with a practically dead list.  Time goes by, and someone has a message
to send on that topic, but hardly anyone even REMEMBERS the new list,
so it ends up going to the old, original pre-splinter list.  This is
a good thing actually, since by that time new people have joined the
original list who have not even HEARD of the new list, since it has
been essentially inactive.

I don't have a TRS-80, or an APPLE, but somehow I have managed to live
with flurries of messages to INFO-MICRO on this topic.  Better to have
the message available -- it can always be deleted.

But maybe I'm wrong.  I propose a poll.  For the purposes of this
poll, I am presuming that the UNIX vs. CP/M messages continue
to occur at a low level and taper off to none within a week or so.

The question is:

DO YOU WISH TO SEE A NEW LIST STARTED SPECIFICALLY TO DISCUSS 
THE TOPIC OF UNIX VS. CP/M, AND HAVE ALL MESSAGES ON THIS TOPIC
DIVERTED FROM ANY OTHER LISTS?

If you feel a new list is called for, vote YES.
If you feel the present situation will be adequate, vote NO.

Please send me your vote.  It should have a subject line
of POLL followed by the single word YES or NO.
If you cannot generate a subject line, please use the first
line of your message for your vote.

I will consider the vote to be ended Tuesday evening at 11:59 PM.

I hope there is no unilateral action taken on this subject before
the vote is concluded.

Subject: UNIX vs. CPM


There are a couple of screen oriented editors available under UNIX,
namely vi (visual editor) which comes with 4bsd, and ned,
from RAND.  Two other comments:  As regards UNIX being new and
unproven vs. CPM being established and proven I think you will
find that the reverse is true, UNIX has been around for a long time.
The only thing unproven about it is the new versions being written
for micros.  But 90+% of the code is independent of this, especially
the utilities.  A big point was also made of the tools available under
CPM.  The author has obviously not been on a UNIX system for a long
time.  As far as I know there is nothing available under CPM comparable
to make, awk, sed, diction, grep, (v)troff, yacc, and lex, which either
alone (or especially when combined using pipes) I find VERY useful
both for system work AND on a day to day basis.  Several months ago we
received a cataloging system we were to use in keeping track of papers
being reviewed for publication in the proceedings of a conference.
It was written in FORTRAN, and the listing was more than an inch thick.
A trial compilation produced 2 to 5 errors per page of code both
from the UNIX FORTRAN compiler and the IBM H FORTRAN compiler.
Rather than convert it, I and one other person rewrote it into
a better and more flexible system using make, awk, sed, sort, nroff,
tbl and col.  This took about 7 hours (total) from me and 2 for him,
and contained not a single line of code in any conventional high
level language, just two or three pages of scripts for the various
utilities (mostly make).  At the time I had 3 months experience
on UNIX and had never used any of the mentioned tools except nroff.
None of this would have been possible on CPM, and in fact the main
thing going for CPM is that it was the only fairly standardized
operating system available for micros, UNTIL NOW.

Subject: Response to Berkeley (3) -- Byron Howes
To:   decvax!duke!unc!bch at BERKELEY
cc:   info-cpm at MC

Greetings,

        In reply to Byron Howes message of 18  June,  from  a  systems
programming   point   of   view,  I  concur  almost  completely.   The
multiprogramming attributes of UNIX  give  it  many  capabilities  and
features   not   found  in  CP/M.   And  UNIX  is  definitely  a  more
sophisticated OS!  I have already outlined such feelings before.

        My  thrust,  however,  is  in  the  direction  of  a  multiple
processor CP/M environment (re bottom of the next to the last  par  on
Page  8 of my 27,700+ message of 15 June).  In this environment, I see
no "user-level" function that he can do which I can't if I wanted  to.
For  instance,  to be notified of incoming mail while I am doing other
things can be done by letting one  of  the  slaves  "ring"  me  on  an
alternate  terminal  or  display  while  I am working with the master.
When the message comes in, I leave the master's keyboard and go to the
slave's.   As  for  after-hours transmission and scheduled processing,
MP/M already supports  SCHED  which  permits  this,  and  my  multiple
processor  environment could do this also (with one slave dedicated to
batch jobs and scheduled processing of other kinds).

        As  for  transportability  of software, I still feel that CP/M
has an advantage over UNIX.  Look at it this way:  if I  were  a  UNIX
user  and  wanted  to  run  Word  Star  under  UNIX,  I  would have to
disassemble Word Star and its overlays into  assembly  language  (Word
Star  is available conventionally only in binary!), decode the meaning
of the program (decidedly non-trivial), and translate into C  or  some
other   form   transportable   to   my   UNIX   environment.    CP/M's
transportability is on the binary level!

        On  the other hand, if I were a CP/M user and wanted to run wc
under CP/M, I would get the source to wc in C and compile it using one
of  the  C  compilers that run under CP/M.  Yes, I may have to do some
translation of the source for inter-compiler compatability and I  will
have  to  have  a library of functions used by wc that are implemented
under CP/M (like putc, getc, etc.).

        Under CP/M (once my C library is built), I need only translate
C source code and compile and link in order to use the world of  UNIX-
compatable  software;  under UNIX, I need to reconstruct programs from
their binary forms, and for programs like Word  Star  (over  80  K  of
binary  on  disk,  incl  overlays), the problem of transportability to
UNIX is definitely non-trivial.

        Mince  (similar  to EMACS) is an editor written in BDS C which
stands as an example.  I suspect that Mince was only  patterned  after
EMACS  (not  copied),  but  isn't  copying  of  the public-domain UNIX
software possible?

Hi 

        Thanks for the data re UNIX editors and mail systems.  Can you
provide references?

        As for your comment  about  standardization  of  CP/M,  in  my
27,000+  char  msg  of 15 June, I claimed that the command interpreter
(re page 2) was NOT part of the kernal [command interpreter = shell of
UNIX and CCP of CP/M].  My CP/M system differs from others in the CCP,
NOT the BDOS (which is where CP/M transportability is  enabled).   The
world  of  marketed software for CP/M is still open to me, and only my
user (console) interface is different.

Hi, All,

        Discussion  seems  to have been renewed!  Marvelous!  It looks
like some real UNIX hackers (system programmer types) have gotten into
the act!  Welcome!

        In response to the first irate UNIX hacker (name unknown) [msg
dted  16  Jun at 20:58:12-PTD from duke!decvax!unc!smb at Berkeley], I
wonder what he read!?!  First of all, I assume he is referring to  the
message  of  15  Jun  at 12:31 EDT from AFITGORDON since it is 27,700+
chars and he made reference to a 25K file.

        The  following  answers his accusations in order (the order in
his message):

        1.  He claims that I said that "CP/M has more proven tools
            than  UNIX".   What  I  said  was  "I  have  not  seen
            comparable  field-proven  software  on  the  NEW  UNIX
            systems" (pg 7), which is not saying the  same  thing;
            to  be exact, I was hoping it would invite information
            which would increase my own knowledge on  the  subject
            of UNIX tools.

        2.  I did NOT say that UNIX has "No screen editor"; what I
            said  was  "Are  there any screen oriented editors and
            formatters?"  (pg 3).

        3.  I  did NOT say that UNIX had "No ability for ...  user
            to have a tailored  command  set";  what  I  said  was
            "special work environments, each with their own set of
            commands, can be easily created" (pg 4, par  1.)   and
            "specialized   shells   or  even  menu-driven  command
            environments can be created with ease" (pg 4, par 2.).

        4.  I   did   NOT   say   that   UNIX   does  NOT  support
            transportability; what I said was "Both UNIX ....   an
            CP/M  are  generally adequate, extensible, and support
            transportable  software"  (pg  7,   2nd   full   par).
            Further,  I  am aware of Bell's portability ideas from
            "Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System", BSTJ,
            Jul-Aug  78,  Vol  57, No 6, Part 2, ISSN0005-8580, by
            Johnson and Ritchie.

        5.  Finally,  your impression is correct concerning my use
            of UNIX.  I have touched it just a few times,  and  do
            NOT have extensive experience with it.  We are running
            UNIX on our PDP 11/60 at AFIT, and I  am  involved  on
            its  committee and have touched it only once.  My data
            in these messages (as I  have  already  stated)  comes
            from  the  Bell  System  Technical Journal I have been
            quoting and our own UNIX manuals.

        Appearantly,  this message has stemmed from the sender reading
all sorts of things into my message.  He has been trying to put  words
into my mouth while we are saying the same thing all along!

        The purpose of my messages  has  been  to  pass  data,  and  I
encourage  your  responses  concerning data (with references) on UNIX.
But let's not launch any personal, critical attacks  based  upon  what
you are reading into what I am saying as opposed to what I am actually
saying.  Your message only provided a minimum of new info  on  V7  PWB
and 32V (UNIX-32 for VAX?), and the rest of it repeated what I already
said (agreeing with me, by the way).  If you do not feel that you have
agreed  with me, cite the page and paragraph in which I said something
contrary to your views.

        If  you  or  anyone else wishes to review the entire dialog, I
have been maintaining a reading file of what I considered  to  be  the
critical messages (both sides) and will be happy to transmit it to you
(preferably FTP it).

because of the nature of the gateway between the usenet and the

operating system in that it has absolutely no process/task management
beyond the timed multiple user support offered by MP/M.  Resource
management, beyond this, is restricted to disk space conservation.  Any
significant operating system functions such as parallel processes and
process control involve actually zapping the os on the fly as in
DESPOOL.

**NIX, on the other hand, provides a full complement of process
scheduling mechanisms which allow users great flexibility in their use
of the system.  For example,  I am currently editing a message to be
sent on (through several other unix systems) to whomever is out there
to read it.  At the same time, I am waiting for mail from whomever
chooses to send to me (an alarm will sound on my terminal if it comes
in \while/ I am entering this.  Should I choose, I can push the editing
session into the background, respond to the message, and recall this
editing session all with process management commands.  When I complete
the message I will drop it off to the system to be sent on at an
appropriate time, more than likely in the middle of the night when I am
not signed on.  Further, I can submit processes to be executed hours,
days, or weeks from now without intervention on my own part.  The basis
for all of this is built in to the **nix operating system.  I do not
believe these capabilities exist in cp/m.

As afitgordon pointed out, any software written for one os can be (in
some sense) transported to another (this may involve a complete
rewrite, but...)  Thus, it is not valid to compare operating systems on
the basis of the software written to run under them.  It \is/ valid to

No screen editor?  I thought vi came out several years ago.  No ability

ONE (except me, now) has mentioned Ada and the  work  being  done  (no
where  near  release) by over 70 major firms (including IBM, Goodyear,
Ford Aerospace, and I forget who else) on the Ada Language  Integrated
Computer  Environment  (ALICE)  and  the  potential  extension  of its
concepts into other areas (including Office Automation)!

        By  the  way,  please  include  me on the new list, but NOT as
AFITGORDON; use CONN@MC.

Hi Budley - I pretty much agree with all your points, except for the
need to do something.  Even though I am not the person who put this
issue into INFO-CPM, or the person who requested that the long CC list
be included on all mail, I have gotten lots of flack from a small number
of people who are incredibly upset about the long CC fields in those
messages.  There is no way to resolve the "long CC" problem without
forming a new list, whether it lasts very long or not.

We have been operating across interest group boundaries with a formal
group included among a mixed informal list of others who could not be
added to the info-CPM list because they are not interested in INFO-CPM
in general.

So far I have about 10 names for the new list, and they are still coming
in.  When we get to 20 or so, I think we should cut over to the new
list.

Then, if the discussion converges to closure, we should all celebrate
the end of the discussion by shutting down the list.  Discussion group
lists are easily created, and they should just as easily end.

Cheers - Stef

I do not agree with your conclusion about needing a new mailing list.  If a

opinion that the UNIX versus CP/M topic will not be "resolved" by message
traffic on this net, but that the quantity of related traffic has essentially
reached its zenith and we will move on to other topics.  This topic appears
to be close to running its course.

Re:   MODEM working!!

	
I managed to get the thing working, using the CPM system calls from PLINK,
as I mentioned earlier.  The problem with the bad sectors was that my 
subroutine to read a character stripped the parity bit, thus providing
a guarenteed wrong header/checksum.  
	
It is a bit of a kluge, but it works.  I used conditionals around all
of the system calls to any MODCTLP, MODDATP, or MOD---- sympols, using
IF TRS  and IF NOT TRS, so that it may still be assembled for other things.

As soon as I get a chance to xfer it over to the PDP-10, I'll let you or

There is a company up in the Boston area (Computer Service Systems

OS that supposedly will allow programs to run 10 to 14 times faster.
The yet unnamed system's description goes on with wording reminicent
of the SPEED writeup and is initially offered for their own Z80-based
general-purpose business computers.  Anybody know better details on
this one?  (Electronics, June 2, 1981, pg. 34)

Out of today's mail:  Electronics, June 16, 1981:

Under the heading (pg. 33) "Xerox to market personal computer..."
with the announcement of the 820 which most of you may have seen
already, is "... with IBM to follow suit" Called Chess, it is an
8088-based system priced between $3-4K, and includes two DSDD 5-1/4
Tandon floppy drives, a detachable keyboard.  An OS "similar to CP/M"
from Microsoft (IBM Personal Computer DOS), from 64K to 256K RAM, and
a "600-by-400-line" B&W display and able to handle eight colors with a
resolution of 400x200 pixels or four colors at 800x400.  Look for it
to be announced next month and check out Sears, Computerland, and

Hi Dave - I feel that this discussion has either reached the point of
becoming an alternating multilogue, or it is about to converge on a
useful focus for discussion of important issues.  Maybe it is time to
establish yet another special focus discussion group mailing facility.
Or it is time to end the discussion.  It certainly seems to be time to
separate this from the entire INFO-CPM list.

May I suggest that you set up a "mail-drop" for this UNIX-CPM discussion
group on UDEL?  I will help establish the initial list, and help
maintain it in any way I can.

The first step as I see it will be to collect requests from recipients
of this message to be included in the group mailing list.  This will
tell us whether there is enough real interest to continue.

I have cleaned out the erroneous addresses that have accumulated into
the CC field by propigation, and have stashed the list in
[KA]<STEF>ADDR.UNIX-CPM:* for who ever might want to grab a copy for
their own use.

I am not sure how many of the recipients really want to receive all this
mail.  Only Jerry Pournelle has complained so far, and I have left him
off the list per his request.

The list for now is as follows:

"[KA]<STEF>ADDR.UNIX-CPM;1":  INFO-CPM@MIT-MC, AFITGORDON@BBNB,
WANCHO@DARCOM-KA, Stef@DARCOM-KA, IME-TECOM@OF2, Labhart@OF2,

Let me answer your message in pieces. First of all Unix runs on
a larger class of systems than just the 11. It runs on a Ahlmahl,
on the Z8000, on the Univ 1110, on the 68000, on the Tandum,
on the Prime and will soon run on the 8086 and the IAPX286 as well
as probably on the new HP 32 bit system. Thats a fair number.

As to CP/M being an old system, I am speaking to the architecture
of the system NOT to its age. While Unix is not up to current "best"
ideas in system organization, it is much better than CP/Ms. (If you
want a better orgnaization try RMX86). 

More latter.

There are actually several 'Unix-like' systems for micros...
Some with good, some with bad reputations.  I haven't used any
of them myself, but consensus seems to be that OMNIX and OS1 are
losers, and Cromix and MARC are winners.  All of these are
Z80 or 8080/Z80 based.  For 68xx fans, there is Uniflex.

Cromix is offered by Cromemco, and I assume therefore that
it is intended only to run on Cromemco machines.  Their earlier
operating system, CDOS, was more-or-less compatible with CPM 1.4,
but I don't know if there is any hope of running CPM2.2 stuff.
For more info: Cromemco, 280 Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94040.
  415 964-7400

MARC has some very interesting possibilities... it boots up under any
CPM system, it does have a CPM emulator (probably 1.4), and has
hard disk support.  It runs on 8080/Z80s.  For more info,
contact: Vortex Technology, POB 2284, Culver City, CA 90230
  213 645-7200

Uniflex, for 68xx machines (I'm not sure which are supported), is a
product of Technical Systems Consultants.  I don't have their
address handy.

Not hearing any screams of pain, requests for removal from the list, or
requests to cease and desist, I will assume everyone else is enjoying
this more or less.

I want to note that I am more interested in the prospects for the future
attractiveness of UNIX vs CP/M (MP/M & CPNet too) than with the history
of either of them.  This is not to say that I do not enjoy knowing the
history.  My point is that my evaluation is based on future potentials
rather than historical facts.

Also, my evaluation is based on an institutional perspective for finding
the best way for an institution to provide personal computing for the
mass of individual employees, rather than in finding ways for individual
employees to do their own thing, whether it be system hacking or not.

I have no disagreement with those who, as individuals, wish to choose
CP/M for themselves.  Indeed, if you are in a position to afford the
luxury of a non-institutional solution, more power to you.  In my own
case, I have this freedom, and I choose CP/M for now because of costs
and availablility.  But I plan to migrate to UNIX/XENIX in about one
year, and I will retain the right to change my mind when I see the real
alternatives when that time comes.

In the meantime, I must advise my clients to plan for the UNIX/XENIX
environment because of its greater potential for meeting institutional
needs, as described in my earlier statement of institutional
requirements.

I hope this clarifies our apparent disagreement.  It seems quite clear
that both UNIX and CP/M will be around for a very long time because both
will provide good value to significant segments of the market.

To: info-cpm at MIT-MC

In reading your commentary, it strikes me that there is one consideration
that is conspicously missing, that of upgradeability.  Although I have
found UNIX to be a whole lot of fun to use (as a systems type), it
is not practicle for some folks to consider.  To reitterate
some of the other comparisions of UNIX and CP/M-80 (note the suffix),
CP/M was designed for a single user small computer on 8080 level,
with at most 64k of memory.  UNIX was designed for an eleven.  It
is very difficult to consider the reletive merits of the two on 
the smaller machines, as (for the moment, and discounting rumors about
the Decision-1) UNIX is not available for the small CP/M machines.
For the larger machines, UNIX is great (but does not have loads of 
business type software).  I should think that for people on small
budgets, who already own an 8000 dollar CP/M type machine,
it would be near to immpossible to upgrade to UNIX on 16 bit
without a major expense.

What I would REALLY (underline that) would like to see would be
a form of UNIX (real live UNIX, not some thing claiming to have a
tree structure) that would run on the Z80 machine and would also
allow CP/M programs to run as well (say in a subdirectory).  If 
this could be done with a minimum of hardware (maybe a $500 board
to do some form of management) and a reasonable priced software 
package, it would be really neat and highly useful.  There
are rumors (I have a not quite working version) of a UNIX
like OS being developed by Ed Ziemba (who had a fatal diving 
accident recently, and whom many will miss) and Leor Zolman,
that is based on BDS C.  Also, the ONYX system is very nice,
provideing multi user UNIX on a Z8000 and hard disk for arround
18000 dollars end user.

So much for putting my two cents in.

In response to the message sent  16 Jun 1981 1855-PDT from Ime-Tecom@OFFICE-2

Hello, Everyone,

        Before I get started, I want to say that I think this exchange
is  FANTASTIC!   I'm  learning  much  from it (and doing much research
because of it), and such a wide diversity of  views  is  enlightening,
entertaining, and enjoyable.

        I hope the following comments are useful, and I hope  I'm  not
deviating  too  much  from  the  original question.  As I view it, the
original question concerned  the  creation  of  a  microcomputer-based
office automation system and which OS should host it.

                                        Richard Conn

-------- Comments Follow --------

                                Part 1

        First,  I wish to take issue to the extreme with Dave Farber's
comments; I disagree with them almost  completely  (sorry,  Dave,  and
please  don't  take  offense, but I feel the following data speaks for
itself)!

        I  refer  to Dave's message (Farber@Udel-EE, sent 16 Jun 81 at
8:58 EDT).

        In  his first paragraph, Dave states that CP/M was created for
processors  with  small  memory  (8080's,  <=64K),  single   processor
configurations,  and  that "Systems based on such ...  assumptions ...
have had severe difficulties adapting as ...  [memory size  grew]  ...
and  ...  [multiprocessor configurations were created]."  I agree with
his statement about CP/M, but I disagree with the  material  I  quoted
and view it an an unsubstantiated value judgement.

        Dave goes on to imply that CP/M is "old fashioned" and  should
be discredited because of its age.  From my point of view (and this is
how I believe he intended us to believe), Dave is saying that UNIX  is
newer  than CP/M and was intended from the beginning to run on "larger
mainframes".  This is not true!

        When I first began work on my Master's at U of Illinois in 76,
I heard about UNIX long  before  I  heard  about  CP/M.   This  memory
prompted  me to do a little research, and the following summarizes the
results of this evenings research --

	
	UNIX				CP/M

o  1st Version:  1969		o  1st Version (1.0?):  1974

o  1st machine implemented on:
	PDP 7 & PDP 9			Intel Intellec? (8080)

o  2nd Version:  1971		o  2nd Version (2.0):  1979

o  2nd machines implemented on:
	PDP 11/20			Many 8080's, Z80's
	  1st released 1970
	  1 processor
	  32K words max memory
	  16-bit words

o  Upward-compatable OS Family:
	Compatability lies is in	Excellent upward-compatability
	C source code; OS "hooks"	on the binary (OS "hooks") level;
	at binary level show no		ASM assembler and PL/M source
	inter-version compatability	compatability maintained
	at all! (this is inferred,
	does anyone dispute with data?)	
   Compatability Synopsis:
	-None-				CP/M 1.3 -> CP/M 1.4 ->
					CP/M 2.0 -> CP/M 2.1 ->
					CP/M 2.2 -> MP/M 1.0 ->
					MP/M 1.1 -> CP/NET (MP/M-based)
					[CP/M 3.0 and CP/M-86 - no data]

o  Number of systems running OS:
	"over 600 installations"	over 200,000 installations
	(1978) on HW costing		(1979) on HW costing
	"as little as $40,000"		as little as $3,000 (my experience)

	

        The  above  information  came from the following sources:  (A)
UNIX info from (A1) "The UNIX Time-Sharing System" (Apr 78), The  Bell
System  Technical Journal, JUL-AUG 78, Vol 57, No 6, Part 2, ISSN0005-
8580 and [for PDP 11/20 info]  (A2)  "PDP  11/20,  15,  R20  Processor
Handbook",  Digital  Equipment  Corporation,  1971; (B) CP/M info from
"CP/M:  A Family of 8- and 16-Bit Operating Systems", Byte  Mag,  June
81, Pg 216, by Gary Kildall [creator of CP/M].

        From the above, the following information is not  documentably
substantiated:   (1)  binary-level  inter-version  UNIX  compatability
[these statements were made based on personal conversations], (2)  the
200,000  installation figure for CP/M [this statement made based on an
ad from Digital Research that I couldn't find  this  evening;  I  have
heard  later rumors as high as 400,000+!, but these are almost totally
undocumented], and  (3)  the  CP/M  $3,000  cost  [based  on  personal
experience with 5 1/4" floppies and 32K bytes memory].

        The compatability I mentioned above should be stressed on  the
binary level!  To my knowledge (based on conversation), the historical
versions of UNIX do not support the  same  hooks  (binary  level),  so
binary  written on one version cannot be transferred to another!  With
CP/M, however, I have written programs in assembly language which have
run  without modification (!!!)  on CP/M 1.3, CP/M 1.4, CP/M 2.0, CP/M
2.2, MP/M, 1.0, and MP/M 1.1!!!!  And  the  machines  that  this  CP/M
program  ran  on were Intel Multibus, IEEE S-100 (Z80), Cromemco S-100
(Z80), Ithaca Intersystems IEEE S-100 (Z80),  and  Electronic  Control
Technology IEEE S-100 (California Computer Systems Z80).  UNIX, on the
other hand, runs only on PDP 7, PDP 9, PDP 11, and  VAX  11  (All  DEC
UNIBUS except for the VAX with is DEC MASSBUS and UNIBUS).

        Another  complaint  was  the  lack  of  multiprogramming   and
multiprocessing  capabilities  with  CP/M.  To dispell these comments,
MP/M 1.1 can support up to 16 users, each having 64K (48K  work  area)
of  memory  and  running  on  a  single processor system.  CP/NET is a
network support system which runs under MP/M (required for  host)  and
CP/M  or  MP/M  (remotes)  which  allows  sharing  of  common data and
programs on each of the satellites (separate processors with their own
terminals,  printers,  and  disks)  with  the  host (also with its own
terminals, printers, and disks).  AND THIS IS  ALL  UPWARD  COMPATABLE
WITH  CP/M  2.2,  WHICH MEANS THAT PROGRAMS WRITTEN ON CP/M 2.2 CAN BE
MADE (SOMETIMES WITH NO MODIFICATION AT ALL!)   TO  RUN  ON  MP/M  AND
CP/NET!!!

        Now that I have issued all of these pro-CP/M arguments, I wish
to conclude by saying that --

                1.  Just because software has  been  around  for
                    some   time  does  not  mean  its  value  is
                    degraded with time; software is good or  bad
                    in  the eyes of the user only, regardless of
                    how long ago it was written

                2.  Although  I sound pro-CP/M, I do not view it
                    as a panacea!  My experience with  UNIX  has
                    been  pleasurable,  and  I  feel it has many
                    concepts which are interesting and of  value
                    (re my first message).

                3.  The OS, again, is just the RESOURCE  MANAGER
                    of  the computer system, and I feel that the
                    real value of the system lies in  the  tools
                    (editors, languages, DBMS's, debuggers, etc)
                    that run under the OS.   Transporability  of
                    software  under  CP/M  is  on the binary AND
                    source level, while  transportability  under
                    UNIX  is  ONLY  on the source level (Is this
                    correct?),  usually  in  C.   If  the   user
                    selects  UNIX, he could very well be burning
                    his bridges to the excellent  CP/M  programs
                    marketed  in  binary  (like MDBS, Word Star)
                    while he who selects CP/M  is  open  to  the
                    CP/M  programs  marketed in binary AND still
                    has the UNIX world open  since  C  compilers
                    run   under   CP/M  and  UNIX  transportable
                    programs are written in C (true?).   If  you
                    could  find a UNIX-like OS with can also run
                    CP/M binaries (OS-1 claims to  do  this),  I
                    feel   that   this  would  be  the  ultimate
                    solution to our discussions.

Whoa Steff-----------

I'm NOT talking about the TECOM cluster machine at all -- My entire
office is 4 engineers plus 3 support persons.  The entire budget for ADP
is in the range of $10K.  Harry's office (TECOM-C3I) is about 7
engineers, 4 support.  We want to be able to be independant of the large
mainframes if we want, but still retain full connect capability.

AFITGORDON's answer has come closest to what we wanted in regards to
comments.

If you know of it, TECOM's DMIS standalone Northstar-based system looks
nearly what we want (I've got some specific objections to that machine
but I really don't know enough about it to see if they can be gotten
around.)

Yes, the answers are going in two different directions, but your view is
not necessary the place I and Harry want to go for our individual office
machines.

I am NOT talking as part of TECOM's DMIS, and in fact have be taken to
task for sending out the requirement list in the first place.  They are
the ones that have all the $$$ and are going for the large main-frame.
I believe there is a place for both macro- and mini's in TECOM and right
now I'm concerned only with "MY" machine.

Although I suspect I'm be doing hacker like stuff on it (per my nature)
the primary use of the IME (International Materiel Evaluation - now
everyone knows where my address line came from!)  machine will be in
production work - messages to other TECOM offices, writting letters,
DF's, briefings, etc.  Primary users will be secretaries, clerks,
support persons who I suspect I'll have to teach after I learn it
myself.  (Sorry, but my wife won't let me but my own home computer until
I get "a couple" more promotions.)

I hope this clears up any misconceptions that I might of coused with the
first message.

Hi All ---

I think we are talking in two different contexts, and maybe even more.
So, here is an effort to refine our understanding of the context of the
original question so we can sort the answers given so far, and those
that are in the pipe for later.

As I see it, the context of the TECOM "Draft Requirements" was that of a
major institution with 5-10 "Computer Centers" serving several thousands
of users in several thousand offices spread across the continental US,
if not beyond.

The annual budget for each of the 5-10 centers might range from 0.5 to 3
million dollars per year, and the overall software development budget
for the next five years might range between 1 and 10 million dollars per
year for "capital" investment in applications software.

This is not an accurate description of TECOM per se, but it identifies a
class of organizations like TECOM.  For those who do not recognize the
acronym, TECOM is the US Army Test and Evaluation COMmand which is a
subordinate command within DARCOM.  TECOM sub-elements include White
Sands Missile Range, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Yuma Proving Ground, and
others, both large and small.  It is important to perceive the scale of
the target institution and its user population.

Now then, comes the question:  What operating systems environment should
be selected to "house" the applications to be developed?  What
"operating systems environment" might provide the richest vein of
software from "outside" sources.  In short, what is the preferred
"domain of software accumulation" for office automation (or workplace
automation, to be a bit more accurate) on which to focus the spending of
millions of dollars each year for applications software to be installed
and maintained in a network environment through some kind of central
software management arrangement?

In this context, the issues do not turn on a feature comparison as much
as they turn on assessment of the attractiveness of the alternative
environments to the total collection of software development
entrepreneurs, both in and out of captive institutions.

In short, view the alternative operating systems environments as
"marketplaces" and ask yourself which one you would risk your investment
dollars in with a new applications software product.  Among the things
you must consider are the size of your market exposure for sales.  Is
the CP/M system the richest market, or is the UNIX environment richer?

As a test of my idea here, I suggest the that CP/M community put
together a paper to show how CP/M provides an environment to compare
with the one described in BYTE magazine:  June 1981; "The UNIX Operating
System and the XENIX Standard Operating Environment."

My conclusion at this point in time is that UNIX provides the better
domain of accumulation for the next five years, and that is where I
would focus my development funds if I were a TECOM.

Please note that I am not a TECOM.  My firm is a one man company with
"offices" at home.  I work like many of you in the net, using the net as
my "electronic automated office."  Like Dave Farber, I want to get my
hands on the larger set of tools being built for the UNIX environment,
and I can hardly wait till a year from now when the economics will let
me get a personal UNIX based system for my private office; one that will
work comfortably in the network marketplace that is surely coming down
the pike.

It is very important to remember is that CP/M is a system created
for  processors  with  small  memory (8080s < 64k) and for single
processor  configerations.   Systems  based  on   such   starting
assumptions, in general, have had severe difficulties adapting as
the memory size available  grew  and  the  systems  aimed  toward
inherently multiprocessor systems.

CP/M is an 'old fashion system'. Unix, while full of problems, is
a  system  that  is  much more in the spirit of forthcoming micro
based software systems. Note also that because  Unix  is  in  the
main  a system for larger mainframes, the micros that use it will
inherit the software that is being  produced  on  and  for  these
large  system  -- not those produced for limited size old fashion
micros.  I for one (and I am sure this will create screams) would
be  happy  to  use  MVS or VMS on a microsystem I had (if it were
available) because of the hugh variety of software that has  been
produced and will be produced for these systems.

So CP/M is fine for what it is. It will live (at least as long as
systems  it  is useful for live). But as a long term system it is
no more viable that was FMS on the 7090.

                              Expands ambiguous filenames and
                              passes result via file to named

SQ, USQ, and FLS were written in BDS-C.  SQ writes out the squeezed
file with a "Q" for the second letter of the extent and also writes
the original filename in the resultant file for USQ to use to rename
the reconstructed version it produces.  Expect an average reduction in
filesize of about 25%.  Sources may be made available as a function of
demand.  (Send requests to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@MC, please.)


PLEASE NOTE: As this list grows, it is best to send queries about
missing files and related complaints to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@MC.  If a
file has been previously announced as being available in MC:CPM; and
doesn't appear to be there, double-check the spelling, then look in
MC:CPM;ONTAPE LIST.  Also check in [DARCOM-KA]<MICRO>.  If it is
listed as being on tape, then get it from the KA.  If it not on tape
and not on the KA, THEN send a note to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@MC.  On the
other hand, if there are files you'd like to see made available from
CPMUG or SIG/M, send a note to INFO-CPM-REQUEST@MC, and we'll see what
we can do to get it for you.

You forgot to mention the obvious.
High on my list of the top ten dumbest
things about CP/M is the fact that it
doesn't maintain file modification times.
UNIX, of course, does.
