   +++ Remote CP/M Software Exchange Systems, List #19 +++

                  Last Revised August 16,1981

==============================================================
 A  summary of all known (and running) Remote CP/M  Software 
 Exchange Systems using XMODEM for program transfers.  It  
 would be appreciated if operators of new RCPM systems will
 transmit the needed information about their systems to Ben 
 Bronson [Hyde Park RCPM (312) 955-4493] or to Kelly Smith
 [CP/M-Net (805) 527-9321]

 Ben  and  Kelly  will attempt to coordinate updates  to  the 
 RCPMLIST as they occur...
