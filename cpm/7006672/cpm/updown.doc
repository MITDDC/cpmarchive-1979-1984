Documentation for CPM;DOWN LOAD and CPM;UP LOAD

:LISP MC:CPM;DOWN LOAD $ File
where the $ is an escape, will print "Type CR when ready" and
wait for a carriage return to be typed.  All other characters
are ignored.  The CR (or any other character typed) is not
echoed.  After the CR is received, File will be printed out on
the terminal in raw image mode, with all control-character
interrupts (^Z,^_,^G etc.)  disabled and echo turned off.  When
it is finished, it will just sit there in this state until you
type 10 ^C's.  This is so you can save the file away locally.

:LISP MC:CPM;UP LOAD $ File 
where the $ is an escape, will print "ready" and then proceed to
read characters from the terminal in raw image mode, with
all control-character interrupts (^Z,^_,^G etc.) disabled, and
put the characters in File.  When it receives 10 consecutive
^C's it will print "done" and finish.  These last 10 ^C's will
get placed in the File, but you won't see them if you look at
the file in emacs.
