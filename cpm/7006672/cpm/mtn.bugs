Thanks for the note, Max.  Glad to hear MTN22a is working well
with your N*.  The running amuck in version 2.1 was a register
clobber problem which was fixed in 2.2.  It was caused by some CBIOSs
clobbering registers.  They are now saved before calling CBIOS I/O.

MTN22a Works perfectly well in my N*.   That old problem (2.1) of the prog.
running amuck upon start-up no longer happens.

Apologies. That doesn't happen if option 1 is selected.

Nulls (^@) are eaten between keyboard and modem...  This in version 2.1; haven't
tried 22(A) yet.

Max, how did you make out with MTN22?  Does it run ok on your North
Star and PMMI modem?  MTN22A is the latest version available here on
MC.  Did you ever determine is the port C0h conflict exists on your
NS?  My understanding is that if you are using NS memory they will get
upset by outputs to that port - even if you don't have the memory
parity option.

It seems MTN does not check whether the dial-tone has been received (for PMMI).
In fact it will start dialing even when the coupler is disconnected from the
phone.  The test routine in the PMMI manual works ok.

The help screen that is supposed to come up after five seconds
when the intercept character is typed does not come up if direct
CBIOS I/O is used.

The code to be deleted is the two lines just above the label LIST10 in
LISTCMD.MAC.

To: INFO-MTN at MIT-MC

In trying to be clever and using Kelley Smith's trick to record ^Z's
(1AH) in the buffer by changing them to 9AH (in TEXT MODE), I left
code in the List Buffer/File routine which strips the parity bit
before checking to see if it is 1AH, the CP/M text EOF mark.  This
turns out to be redundant anyway, as it is checked at another point
(without the masking) before it is returned to this routine.

Since my terminal sees ^Z as the cursor up command from EMACS, a List
Buffer or File will display a premature and false End of File message
when that character has been recorded as 9AH.  However, the buffer is
actually much longer as is still recording, and, more importantly, the
entire buffer WILL be written to disk past the false ^Z.

Here are the patches for MTN 2.1:

	11E2  FE => 00   (11E4 for 2.2)
	11E3  1A => 00   (11E5 for 2.2)
	11E4  28 => 00   (11E6 for 2.2)
	11E5  3F => 00   (11E7 for 2.2)

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

To: BUG-MTN at MIT-MC

It seems that MTN22 (not double-checked in MTN21) short sheets the
buffer after filling it a decent amount.  List Buffer shows it shorter
than it is.  Need to double-check that bit 7 is set for any random
^Z's received in Text mode and that pointers are not being screwed up
somewhere.

This is not an "official answer" from BUG-MTN, but I noticed your
message there and wanted to pass along a bit of info you may find
useful.  If you are using a Horizon mainframe, you cannot use port C0H
for the PMMI modem.  The reason is that that port is used by the
mother board for some sort of parity business with Northstar memory.
Everyone I know who has a Horizon II has had this problem.  It doesn't
seem to matter whether you have the parity option on your memory
boards or not.  The symptom is unexplained bombing of programs used
with the modem.  Anytime the program does an output to port C0H, it
messes up the system memory.
   Around here, Horizon owners have standaradized on port B0H.

I copied, loaded and checked (CRC) MTN21.COM and MTNMSGS.OVR.  The former
goes amuck as soon as I attempt to run it (prints "[" without stop).

I'm running standard CP/M 2.2 on a 56K North Star and have a PMMI-103 
installed and dutifully tested (addr=0C0H).

Can you tell me what could be wrong?   

Thanx --- Max
