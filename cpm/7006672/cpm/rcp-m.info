                 General Notes and Comments
                 --------------------------

         Revised Items 7,8,9, and 10: June 20, 1981 

1.  The  systems listed here only carry programs that will  run 
   under the CP/M operating system,  most of them public domain 
   software  distributed by CPMUG or SIG/M,  the two main  CP/M 
   users'  groups.   Some of the programs involved  (especially 
   those in  BASIC, PASCAL and C but also a few in Z-80 or 8080 
   assembly language) can be converted to run on other machines 
   quite easily.      Systems dedicated to downloading programs 
   for the PET, APPLE, TRS-80 and NORTHSTAR do exist,  however.
   Ask experienced users in your area, or check through  "other 
   systems" listings on local CBBS's, ABBS's, FORUM-80's, etc.

2.  XMODEM  is  a modification of Ward  Christensen's  original 
   MODEM  program  designed  to allow  the  transfer  of  files 
   between the exchange system and yours.   The exchange system 
   needs the program,  not you;  you will probably be using one 
   of  the  many  versions  of  MODEM  itself:   e.g.,  MODEM2, 
   MODEM527,  MODEM 926,  MODEM7,  MODEM71,  TRSMODEM, APMODEM, 
   CMODEM, MBOOT3, etc.  BSTAM and most of the other commercial
   terminal programs will not work properly with XMODEM.

3.  Non-XMODEM program transfer systems are starting to appear: 
   e.g., LICA's BBS on Long Island [at (516) 561-6590; 110-600+ 
   baud; 24 hrs;no callback] has a few downloadable ASCII files 
   but at present  these must be  captured  like CBBS  messages
   and then saved to disk  without any error-checking protocol.
   John Wood, the sysop of Santa Clara CBBS [at (408) 241-1956;
   110-600+ baud; 24 hrs, no callback] has  announced  plans to
   implement  late-night  exchanges;  whether  these  will  use
   XMODEM is not yet clear.  

4.  Some XMODEM systems also operate as real CBBS's,  including 
   those operated by Dick Mead and Steve Vinokouroff.   Others, 
   like Keith Petersen's &  CCCC's  use a  skeletal  subprogram
   for handling messages called "MINICBBS".   Their emphasis is 
   on exchanging software, not bulletin board-type information.
   Most RBBS systems focus on software, but even here there are
   variations...

5.  "CBBS", "MINICBBS", "RBBS" (and a variant, "MINIRBBS")  are
   the user-logging/message-taking programs  used by almost all
   of the  systems on RCPMLIST.  You  will  need one of them if
   you are interested in starting your own  RCPM/XMODEM system.
   CBBS & MINICBBS are assembly-language programs and cost $60.
   RBBS & related programs are in MBASIC and free but not quite
   as good as CBBS.  Ask the sysop of this system for  details,
   or read RBBS-USE.DOC or RBBSNSTL.DOC.

6.  A few CBBSs and RBBSs have software exchange functions that
   require the use of a password. Such systems are not included
   in RCPMLIST.

7.  At  present  (06/81)  the  systems with  the  largest  disk 
   capacity and the most programs up at once are Kelly Smith's, 
   Keith  Petersen's,  Calamity Cliffs,  Jud Newell,  and  Dick 
   Mead,   all  running  9-10 Mb hard  disks.   Bill  Earnest's  
   system  has  a 4.25 Mb hard disk,  all for RCPM  use.   Dave 
   Hardy's sys, with 3 DS drives giving @ 3 Mb is in 5th place. 
   Kelly's CP/M-Net system will add an additional 10 Mb of disk 
   in July, possible running 2 remote users in an MP/M set-up.

8.  Look  for  "Currie's Software Emporium" to appear  soon  in 
   Manhatten  NY,  with 10 Mb hard disk and 110-600+ Baud  PMMI 
   modem...but just a rumor so far.

9.  Hank  Sryszka,  Bearsville  Town SJBBS,  is expected to  be 
   running  under MP/M very soon now...Looks as if Ben  Miller, 
   Columbus CBBS,  is running MP/M.  Tim Nicholas is  currently 
   working on a two-modem system and  expects to be up  with it 
   shortly.John  Wood  (Santa Clara) is doing the same for  his 
   non-XMODEM CBBS system. He may already have it working.

10. The fastest systems are Tim Nicholas', with a Bell 212-type 
   modem,  and  SUPERBRAIN RBBS,  with a  Racal-Vadic 3451, and 
   Tim Cannon,  Palatine RCPM,  with a Bell 212A. All three are 
   capable of 1200 baud,  full duplex, at different frequencies 
   than other micro modems use.  Any of the systems using PMMIs 
   can sometimes reach 710 baud but usually are not trustworthy 
   beyond 600 baud.    Systems based on  Racal-Vadic 3451s have  
   600 baud  capablities  (at  ordinary micro modem freqs)  but 
   may not make use of this.   Chuck Witbeck has just put a R-V 
   telephone   modem  (not  a 3451--one of the $400  kind  that 
   looks like an ordinary telephone) on line that  runs at  600 
   and 300 baud.  

   Two other brands of modem will run at 600: the  IDS on-board
   S-100 modem and Novation's newly announced RV 3451-lookalike
   "triple modem".  Neither are yet used by an RCPM system. The
   other systems on RCPMLIST all run either D.C.Hayes or assor-
   ted  brands of external modem.  They do not  send or receive
   faster than 300 baud.

11. And please, most of these systems operate from private home
   telephones...   be courteous and call only during the posted
   operating hours.
