Users of Microsoft MBASIC 5.2 may find this of interest:

It's sometimes annoying not to be able to LIST a .BAS file
you previously SAVEd using the ,P (protect) option.

If you bring up MBASIC 5.2 and do  POKE 23899,175  then
LOAD your protected file, you will be able to LIST or SAVE
it in normal format.

The 820's claim of Ethernet capability simply means that it has a 
regular serial port, which you could theoretically connect to an
(expensive) Ethernet server.  Of course, you could hook practically
anything else up to one too!

The 820 has been discussed quite a bit in INFO-MICRO... I suggest 
interested parties check through the archives.

I would appreciate information regarding both the IBM personal

           WRITTEN & RELEASED IN PUBLIC DOMAIN BY AL JEWER, 
            SHAWN EVERSON,AND WILLIAM WHITFORD, 10/21/81



THIS DOC FILE EXPLAINS THE USE OF THE VOIC@ SOFTWARE
PACKAGE FOR USE WITH THE SWEET TALKER SPEECH BOARD AND A
Z80 CPU WITH PARALLEL PORT INTERFACE.
ANY OTHER BOARD USING THE SC-01 VOICE SYSTHESIS CHIP FROM
VOTRAX SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE SUPPORTED WITH A MINIMUM OF
PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS.

THIS CODE IS WRITTEN FOR USE WITH AN 8255 PARALLEL PORT
INTERFACE CHIP. THE ONLY HARDWARE DEPENDANT ROUTINE IS
IN VOIC@.LIB, WHICH PROVIDES SETUP FOR THE 8255 AT BASE 
ADDRESS 24H AND READS & WRITES TO ITS PORTS. ANY OTHER
PARALLEL PORT INTERFACE COULD BE USED BY RE-DEFINING
THE PORT ADDRESSES FOR YOUR PARTICULAR HARDWARE.

THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE ARE:

                VMAC.ASM     -> THE MAC ASSEMBLER OVERLAY
                VRMAC.ASM    -> THE RMAC ASSEMBLER OVERLAY

TO MAKE IT TALK:

1) CREATE A FILE OF TYPE .VOC (STARTING WITH TALK@.LIB) WHICH
        CONTAINS THE WORDS YOU WANT TO SAY, ONE PER LINE.
        UNIQUE WORDS CAN BE DEFINED AS PHONEMES. (SEE YESMASTR.VOC
        FOR DETAILS & EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO THIS).

2) ASSEMBLE ABOVE FILE USING VMAC OR VRMAC TO CREATE A .HEX OR .REL
        FILE FOR USE BY THE LOADER (OR LINKER).

3) FOR VMAC: USE LOAD AS YOU WOULD WITH ANY .HEX FILE, TO CREATE A
        .COM FILE WHICH WILL TALK TO YOU.
   FOR VRMAC: USE LINK TO CREATE A .COM FILE, OR DECLARE A MODULE NAME
        AND LINK TO YOUR OTHER PROGRAMS!!!!

4) LISTEN TO IT!!!!



TO CREATE VMAC OR VRMAC:

READ VMAC OR VRMAC.ASM TEXT, AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THERE. YOU CANNOT
ASSEMBLE THESE FILES USING MAC OR RMAC, SINCE SOME OF THE WORDS 
DEFINED IN VOIC@.LIB ARE NORMALLY RESERVED WORDS IN MAC. WATCH OUT!

DAN@MIT-ML 10/22/81 02:13:56 Re: A dim future for the Z8000?
To: Info-Micro at MIT-AI, Info-CPM at MIT-MC
The recent announcement that Advanced Micro Devices has decided to support
Intel's 8086 family of microprocessor products (see page 53 of the 20 Oct 1981
issue of Electronics magazine for more information) paints a dim future for
the Z8000.  While AMD has officially stated that they will continue to
support all current Z8000 products and that they will complete their design
and manufacturing agreement with Zilog, their future design effort will be
exclusively towards the 8086.

It is unclear how this will affect the future of the Z8000.  Clearly, Zilog
is incapable of fully supporting their products (I was at a seminar once
where a marketing person from AMD stated that Zilog was a good second-source
for "their" Z8000).  It is also unclear how AMD will market both micro-
processors which, for the past few years, were in direct competition with
each other.

What I am interested in is how the Info-Micro and Info-CPM communities feel
about the 8086 in comparison to the Z8000.  Some possible questions to 
consider include:

1.  Is one processor greatly superior to the other?
2.  Are there applications in which one processor would be much more
    suitable than the other?
3.  What features on each processor are truly desirable and undesirable?
4.  How does support enter into the picture?  Is current support far
    better for one processor than the other?
5.  What are the trends in industry towards each processor?

I'd greatly appreciate collecting opinions and comments on this.  Some
groundrules:

1.  Please don't flame over the 8086 or the Z8000; try to be as objective
    as possible.
2.  Try to limit comments on the M68000 to the bare minimum, as the merits
    of this processor are pretty obvious.
3.  Citing specific examples in your evaluation are extremely useful.

Please send your opinions and comments directly to my mailbox (DAN@MIT-ML),
rather than to the mailing lists.  I'll edit the letters and send a complete
summary of the results to Info-Micro and Info-CPM.

I'm interested in this because I was originally planning to use the Z8002
in a terminal controller, but now that the 8086/8088 has received such wide
acceptance, I need a bit of feedback from other people before continuing with
my current design.

Thanks    - Dan

	I saw the N* Advantage at the show. Looks like a real
win. It is a compact unit with a nice keyboard, including a
row of special function keys. The bit mapped graphics are
superb. Although I had only a brief look, apparently there is
a text processor which allows entry and display of Greek char-
acters; just hook up a twin track Qume and you have a
high quality technical typing system. The Tandon 5.25 in.
drives are double-sided with hard sectoring (360 Kbytes per
disk). I/O boards and a floating point board can be added on
(six slots). At a discounted price in the low 3K range it
should give the big guys something to think about.

	I looked at the documentation for SuperSoft's
Disk Doctor and commented to a salesman that the public
domain program DU by Ward Christiansen could be used to do
the same things. Well, I must have hit a raw nerve, because
he attacked Ward for comments he had made in print about Disk
Doctor. After he calmed down, he told me he heard this from
his boss and wasn't sure of the name. I told him that I
guessed he was referring to an article by Zoso in Lifelines.
I mentioned the SQ/USQ package for file compression, whereupon
he said they were thinking of selling a Huffman compression
program with a coresponding decompression program (both
written in BDS C). He was a bit shocked when I told him the
source code for SQ/USQ was public.

through info-micro, but I don't want to wait for the I-M digest to
appear!

Anybody out there have any 8080 programs for doing the standard
CRC polynomial calculation used for 9 track tape drives?  Any info 
would be mucho appreciated.  Please note that this is NOT the same
CRC calculation used for disks and/or communications lines.

Thanks much.

My father just bought a TRS-80 model II to do word processing on using SCRIPSIT, Tandy's
losing word-processor. It turns out that scripsit has its own file format which is
incompatible with TRSDOS. Does anyone know about a utility to convert between the two
formats, or, for that matter, between either of them and CP/M?

The 32K problem was found way back, and any of the recent umodem
versions should work fine past 32K.  The protocol description document
on which I based my original version of umodem did not discuss the
issue of sector wraparound, and I didn't have a copy of modem206 with
which to compare when I wrote that version.  I made a calculated guess
as to handling 32K, and the preliminary version of the program (prior
to testing of LARGE files) got into wide distribution much earlier
than I had expected or desired.

Any version except that very first one should be fine -- the current
one on MC, for example.

For some time now we have been transferring binary files between a CP/M
system and a Unix system over an RS-232 line at 9600 baud.  The CP/M end
is a Heathkit H89 running a version of [MC]CPM;MODEM206 ASM modified for
the H89's serial IO; the Unix end is a PDP-11/44 running the umodem program
under V7 Unix.  We have had no trouble at all transferring files in both
directions at 9600 baud with nary a NAK.

(As a sidelight, these files contain speech data that are sampled on the H89,
uploaded to the Unix for signal processing, then downloaded to the H89 for
playback.  We custom-designed a board for the H89 which contains a Mu-law
codec in addition to filters and amplifiers.)

Recently we discovered that the file transfer procedure fails for files
longer than 32K.  Knowing that MODEM206 has no problems sending files
of such length, I examined our copy of umodem for possible bugs.  It appears
that the receive file function compares the received sector number with
the expected sector number + 1, without performing the MOD 256.  After
32K worth of sectors, the sent sector number wraps to zero and can thus
never equal 256; the programs ultimately give up and return to their
respective Execs.  We are using an old (June 1981) copy of umodem and
have been unable to look at the latest copy on [MC]; has this bug already
been discovered and fixed?

Electric Pencil disks use 40 tracks, which works properly on most

This applies to the version written for the old single density board.
I don't even know if double-density or double-sided versions of Pencil
exist, since I quit using it before double-density was available,
and by then CP/M made hardware-dependent programs less necessary.

[North*Star used to share a building with Processor Technology,
and the original North*Star disk system was meant to run on
P.T.'s Sol-20 machine (or any S-100) before North*Star made
their own S-100 box, the "Horizon".  One of the most popular

Subject: NORTHSTAR DISK SOLUTION

I report a solution to my problem and a new question.
 
First the solution.  The "CENTA" version of QUAD disk support allocates
track 34 and 35 on the bottom side as "spare" but uses track 35 and 34
on the top side as logical tracks 36 and 37.  There are no spare tracks
on the top side ( I am at least happy with the extra space this gives me).
The CD command as well as the DISKCOPY command that was part of CP/M only
copies 35 tracks.  This leaves track 35 on the top side uncopied.  The
bottom side track 35 is unused.
 
What a mess.  I now must sort through all my disks and locate those that
are backups made with DISKCOPY and repair them.  In some cases I don't know
the original from the backup. (bad record keeping I guess).
 
The question. Is this the same technique used by other vendors in allocating
the tracks on the QUAD drives.  I am interested in data exchange problems
as well as problems in switching to another version of CP/M.  Does anyone
know the track allocation techniques of QUAD drives on different versions
of CP/M for NorthStar machines.
 
Warning to all you guys that don't know. You may have the same problem.
The answer sure explains why some of my backups "go bad" at the same time
as my originals. ( I often PIP *.* to a clean disk to compact files and then
DISKCOPY back to both working and backup copies.  (fool am I)).
DISKCOPY was easy to fix I hope CD is.

Subject: NORTHSTAR DISK PROBLEM

I have managed to create a CP/M floppy disk that I cannot copy on
my NorthStar.  The disk is a single file that just about fills
a Quad Density disk (312k byte file).  The file can be PIP'ed to
another disk but attempts to copy the disk using a DISKCOPY 
utility provided by  "CENTA SYSTEMS" (the source of the version
of CP/M I am using) or the NorthStar DOS command "CD" produce
a mangled file.
 
The file can be read but part way through the file  is a repeated
block from earlier in the file.  Because the disk copy fails both under
CP/M and DOS, i suspect some peculiar data sensitivity in the NorthStar
Disk Controller.  Before I begin to write all the utilities necessary
to isolate this problem, I want to ask if anyone has observed this 
problem and has a solution or at least knows what is going on.

Subject: Submit and PFLAG under 2.2 CPM
To: dag at MIT-AI
cc: RGF at MIT-MC, INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

  The submit file is written out to the disk backwards, one line
of the text file to a sector in $$$.SUB.  Writing backward allows
the CCP to read the end of the file to get the next sequential line
to process, then remove the last record from the file allocation.
The format of each record (I am using "sector" and "record"
interchangeable here) is <len byte><ascii text><0>...the ending
carriage return is not included in the $$$.SUB record, nor is the
ending linefeed.  There is a public domain available in source form
that is intended as an enhancement/replacement for the Digital Research
SUBMIT program, it can be found in MC:CPM;SUPSUB 11ASM along with
the accompanying documentation file, MC:CPM;SUPSUB 11DOC.  From this
program (given you are conversant in 8080 assembly language) you can
learn the mechanics of how the file is constructed.
  The list flag is located at BDOS origin +30DH in the 2.2 version of
CP/M.  I think the sequence "LHLD 6 ! LXI D,307H! DAD D" should
point HL to the proper location...any non-zero value in this location
will turn on the printer.  Note that this location is not supported
by Digital Research (I found it myself by snooping around in the
BDOS) and will almost certainly change in future rev's of CP/M.

To all Morrow's CP/M users:
  You may have noticed that sometimes the morrow's supplied

though you have entered a legitimate drive.  I had this
problem, and (after several hours) tracked it down to
an error in the code.  The byte at address 01F3H in the
SYSGEN.COM program is ANA L.  It should be ORA L, otherwise
every time you change your BIOS, you may end up getting an
error from SYSGEN!  The code is the part of SYSGEN that
checks for an error after a BIOS drive select.  If HL=0,
then SYSGEN assumes there has been an error and aborts
(which is correct).  However, SYSGEN was checking for
HL=0 by: MOV A,H  ANA L  JZ ERROR.  The correct method
is:      MOV A,H  ORA L  JZ ERROR.  If you use ANA L, then
whenever the H and L happen to have no bits in common,
SYSGEN will screw up!            -Dave Hardy

SQ.C and USQ.C have been removed from MC:CPM because they are
not the current versions of the source code.  I will upload when
they are available.  Do NOT use the old files because a significant

this a couple of days ago.

In the meantime, as I mentioned in my message, SQ-15.COM and
USQ-15.COM are available in MC:CPM.  If you cannot download a

Subject: BASCOM version 5.3 - comparisons
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

The following was received on my RCPM system:

			 BASCOM53.DOC
 (a comparison of Microsoft's version 5.2 and 5.3 Basic compilers)
		     by T.E.M. - 9/11/81

The MBXREF.BAS (MBASIC 5.2 [CP/M ver]) Cross Reference Utility was
downloaded from Prodigy Systems CBBS and compiled using BASCOM ver.
5.3.  Using a Zenith Z-89 with 2mz Z-80, 55 cps Nec Spinwriter at
1200 baud, the 5.2 interpreter version took 592 seconds to xref this
program for both listing and xref (option 3).  The compiled version
took 297 seconds to execute the identical task... a 100 % difference!
The compiled run was printer-bound, ...it undoubtedly would have
run even faster but for the printer speed.

Comparison of BASCOM ver 5.2 to ver 5.3 for MBXREF program:
	5.2 generated a 34 k .COM file for MBXREF.
	5.3 generated an 8 k .COM file, and required the 16 k BRUN file
	    for a total of 24 k total for a single program.

The improvement with 5.3 compounds when two or more programs reside
on the same diskette, however, because BRUN need only be there once.
For instance: to contain twenty copies of the 5.2 mbxref.com would
have occupied 340 k of disk space; whereas 20 copies of 5.3 mbxref.com
plus one copy of brun would occupy 176 k, ....or about half the space.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

	The MBXREF.BAS program is available on several RCPM's.
I have used it a fair amount, and it seems to be very solid.

	Ver 5.3 appears to be at least as fast as 5.2 BASCOM; perhaps
a little faster for some applications.

	BRUN.COM is a 16 k file.  It is the ONLY additional file
required at run execution time.  All the other files distributed
with BASCOM 5.3 are either optional, or requried at compile time.
BRUN.COM does require a license per CPU.

	If you want to distibute your .COM file, but do not want to
buy a BRUN use license for each user, 5.3 does allow you to create
a large .COM file (like ver 5.2 did) which does NOT require BRUN.COM.
This is specified at compile time, and is thoroughly explained in
the documentation that accompanies 5.3.

	I would urge owners of 5.2 BASCOM to pay the upgrade fee to 5.3.
The disk space savings are substantial, and the programs load faster.
If you have been putting off getting BASCOM because of the huge .COM
files created by 5.2 and earlier versions, that problem no longer exists.

Hi --

        As per Keith's request,  I  have  uploaded  DEBUG.MAC  to
MIT-MC.  It is in CPM;DEBUG MAC.

        DEBUG.MAC is a very short macro package which may be used
with  M80 (not MAC as well, tho).  It contains only four routines
for printing messages, printing register values, and  exiting  to
CP/M.

        I wrote DEBUG.MAC long, long ago (in a  galaxy  far,  far
away?),  so take pity on the code.  It's only 4K, but some of the
bells and whistles I would have put into it today  simply  aren't
there.

Re:   New SQ USQ and FLS

Greenlaw's latest SQUEEZER programs are FLS-11, USQ-15
and SQ-15.  The main change is to SQ, which turned out
to have a bug in it--in previous versions, an occasional
combination of characters would cause it to try to generate
code longer than 16 bits, which made the files involved
non-unsqueezable.  Steve Bogolub here in Chicago discovered
the bug, sent files that proved its existence to Richard
Greenlaw, and got a disk with a debugged SQ last week.  It
now checks to see whether a >16 bit code is being generated
and if so prints "rescaling" and goes around again to gene-

		   THE D. C. HAYES SMARTMODEM
		   Convenience at What Price?

			     -----

			     -----


     The folks at D. C.	Hayes have been	splashing a lot	of color
in  the	computer hobbyist magazines lately about their new super
modem,	the  Smartmodem.   Designed as part of their new line of
external computer components  including	 an  outboard  real-time
clock,	 the   Smartmodem  is  a  compact,  attractively  styled
direct-connect modem  that interfaces to your computer through a
standard serial	port.  For this	reason,	the Smartmodem is highly
portable -- you	can easily hook	it up to ANY computer that has a
serial port in no more	time  than  it	takes to plug in a DB-25
connector,  plug  in  the  power and flip the  switch.	  Easily
programmed for auto-answer,  auto-originate, and a host	of other
features, the Smartmodem touts brains and convenience over basic
performance,  an  item	I shall	dwell  on  extensively	in  this
review.	 

     What sets the Smartmodem apart from all other modems on the
market today is	that it	has  a	built-in  microprocessor and the
ability	  to   accept	ASCII	strings	  as  commands.	     The
microprocessor,	 a Zilog Z-8, takes care of  all  the  intricate
programming  that users	 of  other  auto-answer,  auto-originate
modems might be	used to.  With Smartmodem, you just tell it what
you want to do,	 and sit back while it does it.	 No more worries
with timing loops,  delay  constants,  baud  rates, pulse rates,
counting  rings,  etc.;	 the  Smartmodem's  Z-8	and  onboard  2K
control	 program  in ROM does it all for you.	Programming  the
Smartmodem is so simple	 that all you need is a	bare-bones modem
program	that can transmit and receive data to it.  Then	you just
send it	commands to execute and	wait for it to tell you	that its
done.	 No  special software  is  needed  to  run  it,	 but  to
bastardize Shaw, what price convenience?  

     The Smartmodem  is	 a  Bell  103-compatible  direct connect
modem that is capable of running 0-300 baud in either  originate
or  answer  mode.  It has auto-originate/dialing and auto-answer
capabilities.	  It  can  dial	 using	either	Touch-Tones,  or
conventional pulse-dialing, or any combination of the two, along
with such niceities  as	 pausing for a second dial-tone	(such as
with a PBX system), dialing  in	either answer or originate mode,
and a built-in loudspeaker to allow you	to monitor the telephone
line  aurally.	 The modem can be  programmed  to  automatically
answer the phone  on  any number of rings from 1 to 255, and you
can also program how long  the	modem  will  wait  for a carrier
before	hanging	 up.  Seven LEDs on the	front panel display  the
modem's	 status	 including  auto-answer	 mode,	carrier	 detect,
off-hook, receive  data, transmit data,	terminal/computer ready,
and modem ready.  When	powered-up and on-line,	the Smartmodem's
low-profile  silhouette	 and   blinking	 lights	 make  a  flashy
appearance sitting on your terminal.  

     Smartmodem	 is  tall on features,	some  of  which	 can  be
programmed in as power-up  default  values  by	the  use  of dip
switches  located  behind  its front panel.  Almost all	defaults
can be overridden by explicit  commands	 when on-line.	Briefly,
lets take a look at some of Smartmodem's smarts.  

     Each command is sent to Smartmodem's  data	 port just as if
you  were transmitting data to the remote modem.  If  Smartmodem
is in  "command"  mode,	then all data sent to its data port will
be intercepted and  interpreted	 as commands to	the modem.  When
Smartmodem is in the "on-line" mode,  then all data will be sent
on down	the line as with a conventional	 modem.	   So  in actual
practice,  you really have only	to worry with one port for  both
data communication  and	 modem control.	 Your own modem	program,
primitive or intelligent only  has  to	watch the modem's serial
status port to determine when data is available	 to be input, or
when the modem can accept more data.  In this respect,	you talk
to  Smartmodem just as you would any other dumb	modem, with  the
difference  being  that	 the  modem  can  either  be  on-line or
off-line.  In practice,	I found	this to	be convenient but at the
same  time annoying since I was	often sending commands when  the
modem was  on-line  (and  so the remote	computer got a string of
garbage), and at other times  I	 thought I was transmitting data
when all I was doing was filling Smartmodem's  off-line	 command
buffer	with  meaningless instructions.	 Hayes stresses	in their
manual that any	 terminal  software  must keep up with what mode
the modem is in, since there are no status flags to interrogate.

     When in the off-line or command mode,  commands are sent to
Smartmodem as a	string of upper-case ASCII characters terminated
with a carriage	return.	 A minor annoyance is  that Smartmodem's
control	program	doesn't	convert	lower-case to upper-case  before
interpreting  the  command  line.    So	 if  you're  programming
Smartmodem  from  the keyboard,	you have to make sure everything
is in upper-case.   Smartmodem's command buffer	is 40 characters
long, and if you overflow  its	buffer	with  commands or a long
telephone number to dial, it forgets everything	 and  makes  you
start  over.	When  Smartmodem has executed a	command, it will
return a result	code to	 let  you  know	what it	did.  The result
code can either	be a string of ASCII  characters  (preceded with
and followed by	a carriage return-line feed pair),  or	a single
ASCII  digit followed with a carriage return.  In addition,  you
can also  instruct  Smartmodem	to go into a quiet mode	where it
will  not return result	codes at all.	 All  result  codes  are
returned  to  the  host	 computer or terminal via the data port,
just  as  if  it  were	data from  a  distant  terminal.    Very
convenient.  The result	codes that Smartmodem can return are:  


   VERBOSE    NON-VERBOSE    MEANING
   -------    --- -------    -------
   OK		   0	     Command line executed
   CONNECT	   1	     Carrier has been detected
   RING		   2	     Phone is ringing
   NO CARRIER	   3	     Carrier lost or never detected
   ERROR	   4	     Command line error


     Remember that each	of  the	verbose	strings	are preceded and
tagged with a CR/LF pair, and  that  the  non-verbose  codes are
returned  as  ASCII (i.e., VERBOSE would return	0DH 0AH	4FH  4BH
0DH 0AH	and NON-VERBOSE	would return 30H 0DH).	Hayes recommends
that  verbose  mode  be	 programmed  when  the	modem  is  being
controlled from	 the keyboard, and that	non-verbose be specified
when the modem is  being controlled by a terminal program.  Even
so, I didn't like having  to  read two characters in non-verbose
mode.	 If  you  choose  to just grab	the  first  ASCII  digit
Smartmodem returns and don't  input  the  carriage  return, your
UART will flag an overrun error	the next time Smartmodem sends a
result	code or	some serial data to your computer.  Again,  what
price convenience.  

     Assuming  that  Smartmodem	is in the off-line/command mode,
here's a thumbnail sketch  of  just  what you can tell it to do.
Each  command  line must be preceded with  the	characters  "AT"
which instructs	 Smartmodem  to	pay attention -	commands follow.
Then  each  command  consists of  strings  of  upper-case  ASCII
characters which can tell  Smartmodem  to  (optional  parameters
omitted	for brevity):  


   A  -	Answer telephone and wait for carrier detect
   A/ -	Execute	last command buffer again
   C  -	Turn transmitter carrier on or off
   D  -	Dial telephone in originate mode and go	on-line
   E  -	Toggle command line character echo
   F  -	Set full or half-duplex
   H  -	Go off-hook or on-hook
   M  -	Turn built-in monitor speaker on or off
   O  -	Return to on-line state
   P  -	Use pulse dialing
   Q  -	Enable/disable result codes ("quiet" mode)
   R  -	Use answer mode	to dial	a telephone number
   S  -	Read or	set any	of the 17 parameter registers
   T  -	Use Touch-Tone dialing
   V  -	Set verbose/non-verbose	mode for result	codes
   Z  -	Reset Smartmodem to power-up default state
   ;  -	Terminate dialing and return to	command	mode
   ,  -	Command	line pause character
   _  -	Morse code dah symbol
   .  -	Morse code dit symbol
   /  -	Morse code character pause symbol


     The "S" command extends preceding instruction set	allowing
you  to	interrogate or set the contents	of 17 registers	used  by
Smartmodem  to	control	what its doing.	 These 17 registers are:


   S0  - Set ring # to auto-answer on
   S1  - Number	of rings which have occurred
   S2  - Character used	to escape back to command mode
   S3  - Character used	as carriage return in command mode
   S4  - Character used	as line	feed in	command	mode
   S5  - Character used	as backspace in	command	mode
   S6  - # of seconds to wait for dial tone before dialing
   S7  - # of seconds to wait for carrier detect
   S8  - # of seconds of to pause for command line comma
   S9  - # of 10ths/sec	carrier	must be	present	to be valid
   S10 - # of 10ths/sec	between	loss of	carrier	and hangup
   S11 - Touch-Tone dialing speed
   S12 - Escape	code guard time	in 50ths of a second
   S13 - Bit map of Smartmodem's UART status register
   S14 - Bit map of Smartmodem's option	register
   S15 - Bit map of Smartmodem's flag register
   S16 - Enable	or disable loop	back for modem testing


     The 3 bit-mapped  registers  allow	 you  to interrogate the
following:  


   S13 - Parity	enabled	or disabled, parity odd	or even, word
	 length	(7 or 8	data bits), command buffer status
	 (full or overflow), state of data bit 8).

   S14 - Auto-answer default mode on power-up, quiet mode
	 enabled or disabled, verbose or non-verbose mode,
	 baud rate has or has not been acquired, monitor
	 speaker mode ("off", "on" until carrier detect,
	 or "on" at all	times).

   S15 - Originate/answer mode,	full or	half-duplex mode,
	 Touch-Tone or pulse dialing mode.


     In	 addition to the 17 registers, recall that  I  mentioned
the dip	switches that can be set to control the	modes Smartmodem
will default  to on power-up.  To gain access to these switches,
you have to pry	 off  Smartmodem's front panel,	and the	switches
control	the following conditions and modes:  


   Switch 1 - Enable computer control of data terminal ready
	      (DTR) line or force Smartmodem to	always hold
	      DTR high.

   Switch 2 - Verbose/non-verbose mode

   Switch 3 - Quiet/non-quiet mode

   Switch 4 - Command line echo	on or off

   Switch 5 - Auto-answer on 1st ring on or off

   Switch 6 - Enable/disable computer detection	of remote
	      carrier detect

   Switch 7 - Single/Multi-line	phone installation (controls
	      phone lights)


     All of the	dip switch  defaults  except  2, 6, and	7 can be
overridden  after  power-up  by	 simply	 issuing  countermanding
instructions  to  Smartmodem.	 Switches  2,  6  and  7 control
hardware-dependant  features  and  thus	cannot be overridden  in
command	mode.  

     Although most of the commands,  and  mode toggles described
above  are  self-  explanatory,	 some  of them aren't,	so  I'll
elaborate  on some of them now.	 First off,  how  do  you  issue
commands to  Smartmodem	 once  we're  in  on-line  mode?   Quite
simply,	 you  can't!	What you have to do is get back	into the
off-line/command mode and then start issuing commands.	While in
the on-line mode, Smartmodem  checks  all  data	 transmitted  or
received  for an "escape code" character.  If Smartmodem detects
three consecutive  escape codes	preceded and followed by a delay
time during which no  data is being transferred, then Smartmodem
will abort back	to command  mode.   You	will note that registers
S2 and S12 allow you to	set the	escape	code  (default is a plus
sign "+"), and the delay or "guard" time (default  is 1	second).
In  other words, assuming that S2 and S12 have not been	 changed
by the	user  and  Smartmodem  is  on-line,  the modem will STAY
on-line	 until	it  detects  at	least 1	second of  no  activity,
followed by 3 consecutive plus	signs,	followed  by  at least 1
more  second of	no activity.  Theoretically, the only time  this
condition  would  be met would be if the user specifically typed
these three characters,	 but  it  is  not inconceivable	that the
remote	computer  could	 coincidentally	send  this  sequence  of
characters, with the appropriate  guard	 times,	and thereby take
your  Smartmodem  off-line!    (Also,  the  remote   user  could
deliberately  take  your  modem	 off-line  by sending the escape
sequence.  Smartmodem doesn't care whether the	escape	sequence
is entered locally or from the remote computer -- it will  abort
to  command  mode  regardless).	  In this instance, the	only way
that  your computer would know that  Smartmodem	 was  no  longer
on-line	 would	be  for	it monitor the remote carrier detect (an
option	controlled  by	dip  switch  6).    Although  Smartmodem
continually monitors the remote	carrier	regardless of whether it
is on or off-line, and	displays  remote carrier status	with the
front-panel LED, the carrier detect  line  it makes available to
your  computer is only held high IF remote carrier  is	detected
AND Smartmodem	is on-line.  However, when using Smartmodem on a
remote	bulletin  board	 system,  the  escape  sequence	 can  be
disabled entirely.   If	you have done this, the	only way to take
Smartmodem off-line (short  of	pulling	 its  plug) is to either
lose  remote carrier detect, or	for your computer  to  pull  the
data  terminal	ready  line  low.    Either  one  of  these  two
conditions  will  then force Smartmodem	to disconnect and revert
to command mode.  

     A drawback	to  Smartmodem's escape	routine	is that	you will
miss any incoming data	while the modem	is in command mode.  For
example, if want to change  from half-duplex to	full-duplex, you
first have to get the remote  computer	to  wait  by  using XOFF
(assuming  it  can  or	will  respond  to  XOFF),  then	get into
Smartmodem's command mode, issue the duplex mode change	command,
then get back into on-line mode	and tell the remote  computer to
carry  on.   If	you can't get the remote computer to halt  while
you do your thing,  then  you  only  have  two	options: stay in
half-duplex,  or  change  to full-duplex and lose whatever  data
comes in while you're changing	modes.	 Here again, convenience
at what	cost?  Personally, I would prefer  being  able	to issue
commands  to  the  modem  independently	 of  data  transfer  and
sacrifice   convenience	  for	flexibility.	Naturally,  such
flexibility  would  eliminate  the  possibility	 of  controlling
Smartmodem   from  a  dumb  terminal  without	an   interfacing
communications program.	 You can't have	both.  

     You may have  noted  the  Morse code dit and dah symbols in
the command table.  Yes	friends,  Smartmodem can send Morse code
(up to the limit of a single command buffer) using either answer
or originate tones at a	fixed speed  of	 20  words  per	 minute.
Couple	this  capability  with	Smartmodem's  ability  to turn a
transmitter on or off (or lots of other	things as well),  and we
amateur	 radio	operators have a neat little package for sending
ASCII over our radios at up to 300 baud.  The Morse code feature
allows the computer  to	 identify  each	station	at the 10 minute
intervals demanded by the FCC without  the  operators  having to
intervene.    However, those of	you with other super modems  can
have the same capability  if  you're willing to	do a little more
work.  Smartmodem just makes it	more convenient.  

     Those other special command  mode characters also deserve a
little	more  explanation.  Normally,  when  you  issue	 a  dial
command, Smartmodem goes off-hook (picks up the	phone),	waits at
least  2  seconds   for	  the  dial  tone  (the	 delay	time  is
programmable of	course), and  then  proceeds to	dial.  If you're
dialing	from a PBX system where	you have  to  dial one number to
get  an	 outside  line,	 Smartmodem  can handle	that  by  giving
Smartmodem the outside line access number  (say	 9),a comma, and
then the number	to dial.  Smartmodem will then dial  9,	wait for
the  number  of	seconds	programmed for the comma, and then  dial
the rest of the	 number.    As	mentioned  earlier, you	can also
switch between pulse dialing and Touch-Tone  dialing in	the same
dialing	operation.  For	example, if your PBX system doesn't have
Touch-Tone capability but your outside lines do,  you  can  have
Smartmodem  dial  9  with pulses, wait 2 seconds for the outside
line dial tone,	then dial  the outside number using Touch-Tones.
The advantage of this setup  is	 that  Smartmodem can Touch-Tone
dial a number incredibly fast (I mean, REAL fast), and if you're
in  a hurry, dialing an	11 digit number	with  Touch-Tones  is  a
hell  of  a  lot-faster	 than  using  pulses, even at the 20 pps
accepted by some exchanges.  Smartmodem's  Touch-Tone capability
also  allows  you  to  use  your  computer with	the  new-fangled
computerized banking systems where you call your bank's	computer
and   then  use	 your  telephone's  Touch-Tone	 pad   to   give
instructions to	the bank computer.  Smartmodem can automate this
process	 by  using  the	 semi-colon  at	 the  end  of  the  bank
computer's  phone number.  Normally, Smartmodem	goes on-line and
waits for a carrier  after dialing a number.  But the semi-colon
forces it to revert to	command	 mode  after  dialing so you can
give it	further	commands.  Switch the speaker on so you	can hear
the bank computer talk to you, and have	Smartmodem  talk  to the
computer with Touch-Tones!  Incredible!	 

     The astute	reader has probably concluded that I really like
this little gadget, and	I do.  But I don't want	one to have  and
to  hold  for  my  very	own forever and	ever, because Smartmodem
does have some limitations  that  I  don't  particularly want to
live with.  Before I go	into the negatives, please remember that
I  am speaking from my own experience, and with	 an  eye  toward
what  I	 personally  want  to  do  with	a super	modem.	For you,
Smartmodem might be just the ticket  --	 but  not  for	me,  and
here's why.  

     Let  me  say right	off that for folks who don't plan to use
Smartmodem for any kind	of bulletin board or RCP/M applications,
either as a user or as a SYSOP,	Smartmodem is a	good buy for the
money.	It has	all  kinds  of	bells  and  whistles  that don't
require	 an intimate knowledge of assembly language and	 digital
electronics  to	implement.  In a word, Smartmodem is CONVENIENT,
and even at the	 retail	 price of $279.95, its a steal.	 But for
people like myself who aren't  afraid  of  getting  their  hands
dirty  at the machine language level, who don't	enjoy paying  Ma
Bell more  than	 she deserves, and who want maximum flexibility,
Smartmodem's convenience becomes an insufferable burden	to bear.
First and foremost,Smartmodem can only go up to	300 baud.  While
the vast majority  of  bulletin	 boards	 and  timeshare	services
can't  go  any	faster either (not with	Bell 103-compatibility),
the majority of	the  RCP/M  systems that I regularly do	business
with can and do	run at 450 baud	 and  higher.	 When you figure
that  a	 file can be transferred in half the time at  600  baud,
you're talking about a considerable savings on phone bills.  For
heavy dialers, that savings could well pay for the extra cost of
a high-speed  modem  and  then	some.  From the	SYSOP's	point of
view, even with	alternative long-distance  services available, a
lot of RCP/M users are going to	higher baud  rates  and	an RCP/M
system	worthy	of  the	name should be able to accomodate  those
people.	 

     Secondly, even though  Smartmodem	can  run from 0-300 bps,
you can't change the baud rate on the fly.  Smartmodem gets your
baud rate, word	length,	and parity mode	the first time you issue
it a command, and that's where she stays.  If  you  power-up  at
300  baud,  and	 a user	calls in at 110	baud, tough nookies.  So
the 0-300 bps capability is there, but with a big "gotcha".  

     Thirdly,  Smartmodem   is	 timing-oriented   rather   than
logic-oriented.	   For	example, after dialing another computer,
Smartmodem can't tell when  the	 other	phone is ringing or when
its busy.  It simply waits a certain amount  of	time (default of
30 seconds) for	a carrier.  If it doesn't get one in that length
of time, it disconnects.  This limitation means	 that Smartmodem
can't  be  used	to dial	a ring-back system without the	operator
sitting	there  riding  shotgun and manually issuing a command to
disconnect on the first	 ring,	and  then  dial	again.	In other
words,	you  can  do it	under operator control,	 but  not  under
software control.   However,  giving credit where credit is due,
Smartmodem can handle ring-back	 ANSWERING,  as	a bulletin board
modem driver can simply	monitor	the rings register  just as with
any other auto-answer modem -- only with Smartmodem its	 quite a
bit more awkward.  

     From  the	programmer's  standpoint, Smartmodem is	slow  to
program	and slow to respond to	programming.   It takes	at least
1/4 of a second	for the	modem program to accept	 a  command  and
issue  a response code.	 Plus, the speed with which commands and
result codes  can  be  transferred  is limited by the baud rate.
Aside  from being slow,	Smartmodem is  awkward.	   ASCII  string
programming  is	 convenient  for  BASIC,  but  at  the	assembly
language  level,  its  very  inefficient  to have to run through
lookup	tables and look	for 2 result codes instead  of	1.    It
seems the  folks at Hayes were going primarily after the turnkey
user in	designing  Smartmodem, and the end product is emminently
suited for them.  To  an  end  user conversant with a high-level
language such as BASIC,	with only  limited knowledge of	assembly
language (and no desire	to learn more),	 Smartmodem  is	a little
jewel.	But to someone such as myself who prefers to program  in
assembly  language, Smartmodem is like a black hassle box that I
can't get into	deep enough to have it singing and dancing to MY
tune, instead of  to  the  tune	 D.  C.	Hayes wrote for	it.  For
example,  I  don't  like the way you have  to  escape  from  the
on-line	mode.  If you  send  Smartmodem	the escape sequence, the
other end gets it too.	If you disable the escape sequence, then
the only way you can get back  to  command  mode  is by	fiddling
with the DTR line -- and that will disconnect you from the phone
line.  My basic	gripe then is that I want more control	over the
modem than what	the law	allows.	 

     Although	Hayes	doesn't	 publish  much	in  the	 way  of
meaningful specifications  for Smartmodem, my experience with it
on-line	leads me to believe it leaves a	bit to be desired as far
as sensitivity and selectivity	are concerned.	Connections that
never  gave my acoustically- coupled  Datec  any  problems  have
kicked Smartmodem  off the track.  In all honesty however, those
same marginal lines  also  gave	 a lot of other	modems I've used
trouble	 as  well.  I would say	that  Smartmodem's  performance,
although less than ideal, is par for the course.  And finally, I
don't like having  yet	another	 serial	 port  tied  down to yet
another	modem.	I would	much prefer to have a modem board that I
can  plug  into	 my S-100 buss.	 Motherboard slots are free  and
available - serial  ports cost money (and what with the	price of
gold these days, DB-25s	ain't cheap either).  

     So	there you have it, the D. C. Hayes Smartmodem.	Now that
I have completed my evaluation	of  the	 little	 booger,  I have
reluctantly  decided not to give him a home in my computer room.
To the question	 I posed quite a few words back	about what price
convenience, my	answer	is  flexibility.    Smartmodem	has more
bells  and  whistles  than a merry-go-round, but I frankly don't
need them.  If I could summarize Smartmodem in a phrase, I would
have to	say that its TOO  SMART!   For me, and for most	CBBS and
RCP/M operators, the Potomac Micro-Magic  MM-103  is  still  the
best  show  on	the  road  .. but Smartmodem sure puts on a good
warmup act.

      MODEMS - AN OVERVIEW FOR BULLETIN	BOARD IMPLEMENTORS

			     -----

			by David Boruff
		      Maryville, Tennessee
			8 September 1981


     For  the  past  several  months,  I've been researching the
market in an attempt to	find the all-time  hot	set-up	modem to
use with my own	CBBS-RCP/M system.  I've finally made my choice,
and  perhaps some of my	thoughts and observations will help  you
make yours.  

     To	 get  a	bulletin board or remote file transfer system on
the air, you need  more	than just a simple acoustic coupler such
as the widely-used Novation CAT.  As a minimum,	you need a modem
which can automatically	 answer	 the  telephone,  run  in either
answer	 or   originate	  mode,	 and  offer  a	high  degree  of
sensitivity, selectivity, and  immunity	 to  both electrical and
acoustic  noise.    Although  auto-originate is	nice,  it  isn't
necessary for a	bulletin board system since its	primary	function
is to answer calls, not	originate  them.   But since most people
who implement a	bulletin board or RCP/M	system	also  use  other
systems,  the  added  flexibility  offered  by an auto-originate
modem is worth paying a	little more for.  

     The requirement that the modem should be capable of running
in either answer or originate mode may not be obvious, but it is
important.    Normally,	 a caller dials	up a bulletin  board  in
originate mode,	and the	bulletin  board	 answers in answer mode.
For the	unitiated, the originate/answer	terms refer primarily to
the various tones that are used	to transmit and	receive	data.  A
binary	1  (or "mark") is transmitted at one  frequency,  and  a
binary 0 (or  "space")	is  transmitted	 at  another  frequency,
(usually lower in pitch	then the mark tone).  The difference  in
frequency  between  the	mark tone and the space	tone is	referred
to  as	the  frequency	shift,	or  just  "shift".    Ham  radio
enthusiasts will recognize  the	 mark, space, and shift	terms as
being hang-overs from teletype terminology.  

     In	 addition to having a difference  in  frequency	 between
mark and space,	 there is also a difference in frequency between
answer and originate.	 Typically,  an	 answer	modem's	mark and
space  tones  are  about  1  KHz  higher  in frequency	than  an
originate  modem's  tones, but both still use  a  common  shift.
With Bell 103 type modems, the answer modem marks at 2225 Hz and
spaces at 2025 Hz (a  shift  of	 200  Hz).   The originate modem
marks at 1270 Hz and spaces at 1070 Hz (again,	a  shift  of 200
Hz).  In practice, the answer modem transmits at 2225/2025,  and
listens	 at  1270/1070 Hz, with	the originate modem transmitting
at 1270/1070,  and  listening  at 2225/2025 Hz.	 In this manner,
both modems can	talk at	the same  time	since  each  ignores the
tones  its  transmits,	and  only  recognizes  the  tones  being
transmitted  by	 the  other  end.    This  is  referred	 to as a
full-duplex  system  because  communication  is	possible in both
directions simultaneously.  There is nothing particularly  magic
about  the  Bell  103 tones, although they were	chosen with some
thought	as to the characteristics of the telephone network.  But
other frequencies and  shifts  can and are used	by other modems,
Other frequency	and shift combinations are possible, and in fact
are used on non-Bell 103 type modems, particularly those capable
of running at 1200 baud.  But remember	that  a	 modem using the
Bell  103  type	 tones	can only communicate with another  modem
using  the  same tones.	 A  Bell  103  modem  can't  talk  to  a
Racal-Vadic 1200 baud job, at any baud rate.  

     Okay, enough  terminology.	   What	 difference does it make
whether	my modem transmits in originate	or  answer  mode as long
as  the	 guy  on the other end is using	the complementary  mode?
Assuming that you  have	 a  good  connection,  it really doesn't
matter.	   But	on  a  noisy telephone line, the frequencies  do
matter,	since certain types of spikes and garbage may affect one
tone pair more than the	other.	There are those	who contend that
the high tones are more	 immune	to noise than the low tones, and
there are those	who contend  the  opposite.    I contend that it
depends	on the type of noise being encountered,	but it is a fact
that  you  can	sometimes  salvage  a bad connection  by  simply
swapping tones.	 That is, let the answer  modem	go to originate,
and let	the originate modem go to answer.   If the data	is being
transferred primarily in one direction only, such as when XMODEM
is sending a file, and infrequently listening  for  a  handshake
character, "flipping" tones may	make all the difference	 in  the
world.	However, if data is being transferred in both directions
equally	 often,	 flipping tones	probably won't help since you're
just transferring the hits from	one end	to the other.  

     So	we see that  the ability to change tones in midstream is
important.  It should  be  obvious  as	well that if you have an
answer-only modem, you can't use it to dial-up	another	bulletin
board or time-sharing system, since the	other end  will	be using
the answer tones when it picks up the phone.  

     What other	desirables are there to	consider before	buying a
modem?	 Well selectivity and sensitivity are very important  in
that they  allow  you're  modem	 to  communicate  on  a	marginal
telephone  line.    In	this respect, all modems are not created
equal.	A modem	featuring high selectivity usually has some sort
of crystal-controlled filtering	system to allow	it to zero in on
the precise mark and space  tones  its	listening  for,	 and  to
ignore	other  garbage	on  the	 line.	High selectivity is very
important in an	acoustically-coupled modem because the modem may
pick up	ambient	room noise along with the tones.  With a popular
low-priced modem I've played with,  I  can  raise  all	kinds of
havoc  by having my stereo going at the	same time I'm trying  to
transfer  data.	   The	reason	is  that if the	music contains a
frequency close	to the frequency of the	mark or	space tones, the
modem will get confused	unless it really  notches out everything
except the tones its looking for.  With	a direct-connect  modem,
you  avoid  the	 problem  of room noise, but noise, ringing, and
echoes on the line still make high-selectivity very desirable in
either type of modem.  

     Sensitivity is also a big deal, since it determines how low
a signal level you're modem  can work.	A highly-sensitive modem
can pull a signal out of the mud  where	 a  less-sensitive modem
would  either fail to hear anything at all, or	at  least  would
plague you  with  drop-outs  everytime a little	pop ambled by on
the line.  As with selectivity,	 sensitivity  is  more important
with  an  acoustically-coupled	modem than with	a direct-connect
modem  simply because the direct-connect  modem	 won't	have  to
listen for the tones through any room noise it might pick up.  

     Both sensitivity and selectivity have to do with how well a
modem will  receive  data.    But  when	 transmitting  data, the
frequency  stability  of the tones being generated is important.
You  don't want	a tone oscillator  that	 drifts	 off  frequency,
especially  if	the  other  guy	is using a modem with very sharp
filtering  ("high selectivity").    The	 best  modems  currently
available  at  hobbyists  prices  all  use  crystal-  controlled
oscillators  to	 generate  the	tones,	and  since  this type of
circuitry  is  cheap to	design and manufacture,	stability  isn't
much of	a problem with all but the cheapest of modems.	However,
an acoustically-  coupled  modem can get fouled	by the telephone
microphone element.  The tones	could  be generated by the modem
right on frequency, but	if the carbon microphone element used in
most  handsets has packed down,	the tone  could	 be  transmitted
down  the   telephone	line  either  distorted	 or  shifted  in
frequency.  Replacement	microphone  elements are available, such
as the Novation	Super Mike, which are  superior	 to the	elements
used  by  Ma Bell.  I can testify from personal	experience  that
the Novation  element  does work and has frequently made all the
difference in the world	 on some connections.  If you go with an
acoustic modem,	no matter  how	good  it  is, I	would definitely
recommend that you install a Super Mike	as standard equipment on
your modem telephone.  Its a ten buck miracle.	

     From the previous discussion, you may  get	 the  impression
that  a	 direct-  connect  modem  is  definitely superior to  an
acoustically-coupled job.  Theoretically, this line of reasoning
is correct.  In	actual practice	however,  change "definitely" to
"maybe".  My arsenal of	computer equipment  presently includes a
Datec  32  originate/answer acoustic modem, and	 I  can't  speak
highly enough  of  it.	 Its ugly as sin and bulky as bulldozer.
When the handset is inserted  in the coupler, you have to strain
your neck to see the receive-data and carrier-detect lights, and
it takes too long to acquire carrier-detect.  But when the going
gets tough and a lot of	other highly-touted  modems are	ready to
throw in the towel, Datec just hums right along.    With a Super
Mike-equipped  handset,	 the  Datec  is	 a  damn  fine piece  of
equipment.   Hobbyists seldom use them,	but professionals  swear
by  the	 entire	  line	 of   Datecs.	 If  you  want	a  basic
originate/answer modem with performance	 second-to-none, and you
don't need all the fancy auto this and auto  that,  the	Datec 32
and a Novation Super Mike is what you want.  

     Why this testimonial about	a bare-bones acoustic modem when
we're  talking	about  super-modems?	Simply	this:  the Datec
acoustic  can outperform some of the best direct-connect  modems
on the market  today  including	 the  CATs, U.S. Robotics, D. C.
Hayes  Micromodem  100,	 Microconnection,  and	several	 of  the
high-priced  Racal-Vadics (all	Bell  103-compatible).	  In  my
opinion, you're	 going to have to spend	a big (as in BIG) wad of
money	to  get	 a  Penril   or	  some	 other	 top-of-the-line
"professional-quality"	modem  that  will work any better at the
basic level than my Datec.  So don't let anybody tell you that a
direct-connect	  modem	   will	   "always"    outperform     an
acoustically-coupled  modem.	If  all	 other factors and basic
specifications are the same, a direct- connect	modem  WILL do a
better	job.	But  a	well-designed  acoustic	coupler	will run
circles	 around	 a  poorly-designed direct-connect  modem  every
time.  

     A	companion  article  may	 be  available	on  this  system
reviewing a newcomer  to  the direct-connect super modem market,
the D. C. Hayes	Smartmodem.    Anyone thinking of using	this new
product	on a CBBS or RCP/M type	 system	 should	read this review
before making your purchase.

I just tried HELP16.COM in user 6 on A: drive.  I did HELP with
no argument.  After the program printed its default message, I
pressed RETURN and returned to CP/M.  I then found myself in
user 0.  It wasn't a fluke.  I tried it again and the same
thing happened.  If you are going to change user numbers while
a program is running, and the program does not do a warm boot,
you must save the original user number or pick it up from the
high nibble of address 4 and then restore CP/M to that user
before RETurning to the CCP.

I would like to see an assembly option which would allow HELP to
look for its .HLP files on other than drive A:.  On a hard disk
system, for instance, it might be desirable to tuck the .HLP
files away in user 15 of drive B: or C:, especially if there are
a lot of .COM files on drive A: because a patch has been made to
the CCP to allow drive A: user 0 to be "public".  (see 22PUB ASM

Subject:   HELP Version 1.6

Hello, Everyone,

        I have just uploaded the latest version of my HELP system
to MIT-MC into AR2:CPM.  The files are as follows:

File Name       MIT-MC File Name        CRC     Size K  Comment

HELP.ASM        HELP16 ASM              CF 52   34      Source
HELP.HLP        HELP16 HLP              21 FE   24      HELP File
HELP.COM        HELP16 COM              84 68    4      Binary

        HELP.ASM can be assembled using ASM of CP/M or  MAC.   It
uses  long  symbol  names,  so  M80 will probably have difficulty
(HELP's parent is HELP Version 1.1).

        HELP.HLP is a rather complete description of how  to  use
HELP and how to write HELP Files.

                        Extended Features

        HELP Version 1.6 is upward-compatable with  HELP  Version
1.1.   Any  HELP Files created under this previous version should
be usable in their current form under  1.6;  the  only  potential
problem  is  with  those files which are close to the size of the
TPA.  If anyone has problems, please let me know.

        The user can now move BOTH forward and  backward  through
an  Information  Section under 1.6.  1.1 could not move backward.
There is also a provision under 1.6  for  jumping  to  the  first
frame  of  the  current  Information Section from anywhere within
said Information Section.

        The most outstanding (my opinion) new feature of  1.6  is
the fact that it supports a tree information structure.  One HELP
File can "call" another which, in turn, can "call"  another  (in-
cluding the original caller -- recursion).  Each time a HELP File
is "called" a new HELP Level  is  entered.   The  user  can  move
around  the  called HELP File as though it was the root (the file
loaded by the HELP Command originally), and he can move back down
the  tree  to the previous HELP Level, returning to the HELP File
which called him.  By default, up to 10 HELP Levels are  support-
ed, but this can be increased by changing one EQUate.

        The tree structure offers much flexibility to the creator
of  the  HELP  Files, and the major fault (my opinion) of 1.1 was
the limitation to the size of the  HELP  File.   This  limitation
still  exists  (HELP Files must load completely into memory), but
it is not nearly as restrictive since when  a HELP  File  becomes
too  large,  it  can  be  broken  into  smaller units (as many as
desired) which can be used under HELP Level 1.  These units  can,
in turn, be broken up.

        I'll be releasing HELP Version 1.6 to SIG/M soon as  part
of  a package of utilities, and I'll place the other utilities on
MIT-MC as they become ready for release.

        Enjoy!

I think it would be a good idea if persons making program submissions
to CPM; include some sort of documentation or summary file that does
NOT have to be unpacked to be read.  If the only documentation is 
in packed format, it forces the user to go through the (possibly 
painful) file transfer procedure simply to read the documentation.
After reading it, they might well find they were not interested.
I doubt if a short unpacked summary file would significantly 
affect disk space.

***********************************************************

	Diskette Drive Cleaner Information  08/81

***********************************************************

   About a year ago, diskette head cleaners began appearing
on the market.	Coming from a large computer environment, I
immediately got some of these thinking I would use them once
or twice a week at all locations where I have microcomputers
installed. The operators at those locations are not computer
hobbyists or technicians; I could not see myself asking them
to scrub the heads with a llllooooooonnnnnnggggggg Q-TIP and
some alcohol.

   I thought they would be more likely to do it if it were a
simple operation, ...like squirting a little squeeze bottle
and inserting a diskette.

   I was notified that both diskette drive manufacturers of
the drives we were using screamed in pain and issued state-
ments that users were NOT to use those abrasive devils in
their products because of possible damage to the heads!

   The producer of the cleaning diskettes said "no problem".
He would not agree to replace any heads found to wear out
prematurely, however.  I figured that the lawyers at the
manufacturers were protecting their clients from warranty
expense, etc. by forbidding the use of the cleaners, but
who knows???

   We stopped using the head-cleaning diskettes, and let
the oxide build, and build, and build.	Is it better to
have clean, worn heads? ....or dirty "unworn-so-much"
heads?

   Yesterday, my dealer informed me that he has made some
progress. His understanding is that Tandon will permit the
use of 3M and ICP cleaners of recent vintage. The story is
that those companies reduced the head-damaging characteristics
of products they produced prior to spring of this year.

   If this turns out to be the case, then non-technical users
will get a break.  Certainly, the drive manufacturers did not
provide access to the heads (even in bare drives in some
cases) for cleaning.  This has been one more maintenance
weakness of micros swept under the rug until now.

   It would be nice for the end user if 3M and Tandon or MPI
would agree that the cleaners should or should not be used.
Sorry I don't have an answer, but I just wanted to notify
you that there has been a problem, and that there is some
movement toward resolving it.

-----------------------------------------------------------

   While we're talking about head wear, let me warn you about
using SOME "single-sided" diskettes in your double sided drives.
Seems that some 8" diskettes labled "single sided" are not even
burnished on the second side!  Ouch!!  Those of us with double
sided drives figure we can jam anything into them and read OK.
NOT ALWAYS TRUE!  We may be grinding down the second-side head
in some cases.

   Ya'all better check your media.  I'd suggest you order only
diskettes which CAN be safely inserted into double sided drives,
even if you have only single sided drives now.	You may upgrade,
or use a friend's system. No sense using your drive to do the
burnishing job!

   Regards.    Tom McCormick	 Houston, Tx.

Subject: Static RAM .DOC
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

Another DOC file goodie recently received on my RCPM system:

STAT-RAM.DOC:  Prices and Capabilities of Recent S-100 Static RAM Boards

                              Ben Bronson, HP/RCPM
                              312-955-4493, 8/5/81

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talking  with one of the people at a local computer store the  other  day 
made me realize that many, including professionals, have not been keeping 
track of the recent dramatic increases in static RAM capabilities and the 
equally dramatic drops in prices.  

Most  of us are used to paying about $300 for an assembled and tested  S-
100  l6k static board.   While traditional prices for dynamic RAM  boards 
have not been a lot less in 16K configurations, we are also accustomed to 
a 2:1 price advantage of dynamic over static in 32K and larger configura
tions.

Now,  no  one disputes that static RAMs are a lot less temperamental when 
it comes time to put a new board into a computer and boot the machine up.  
Statics have many fewer timing problems,  and tend to run faster,  hotter 
and, some think, more reliably.  These advantages have made many computer 
users willing to pay the 2:1 premium for static rather than dynamic  RAM.  
Altough  they have generally believed that dynamic RAMs were the wave  of 
the future, they have gone on buying static and waiting.

But  the situation now seems to have taken an unexpected  twist.   Almost 
unnoticed  by  many  experts,  statics are undergoing a  strong  revival, 
especially in the S-100 field.  The market has suddenly been flooded with 
offerings of new,  ultra-high capacity static boards which are (1) relat-
ively cheap,  (2) compatible with almost all processors and disk control-
lers, and (3) very fast indeed.

Static  boards  now run at twice the speed of any  dynamic  board.   Many 
static brands are fully compatible with the new IEEE S-100 standard; even 
the most recent and expensive dynamic brands rarely are.   And the  price 
differential  has  declined so far that one can often find static  boards 
that are actually cheaper than equivalent dynamic boards.

This  situation is not reflected in the inventory of the average  dealer, 
who  still may have boxes full of memory boards bought last year and  who 
may not have made recent price comparisons anyway.   The following  table 
is  therefore  offered  as a aid to both dealers and their  customers  in 
deciding what to stock, recommend, and/or buy.   This writer's feeling is 
that  the  table  gives good reasons for insisting on  recent  models  of 
static  memory boards in all cases except when the main consideration  is 
to have massive amounts of memory (128k, 254k or 512k) on a single board.  
Static  boards of 1979-1980 vintage,  with 16k at @ $300,  should not  be 
bought.   Famous-name dynamic boards offered at similar prices should  be 
laughed off the market.

The  data  in the table was extracted from advertisements in  the  August 
1981  issue of Byte.   Omissions should generally be interpreted as nega-
tives or as specs the manufacturer is not proud of.   Positive statements 
about included features should of course be taken with a grain of salt.

without IEEE-S100 compatibility,  bank selection, extended addressing, or 
ability to run with DMA) sells for $180 for 16k and $360 for 64k, and the 
fancier  ones  (i.e.,  Systems Group with "IEEE compatible timing" but  a 
maximum speed of 4mz, no extended addressing and very limited DMA capabi-
lity) for $495 for 32k and $749 for 64k.

Hi --

        UMODEM Version 2.9 is now on MIT-MC as CPM;UMODEM  C  and
CPM;UMODEM  HST  (source  code  and  history  file).  The primary
difference between this version and 2.8 lies in the redundant use
of  parentheses  in  places  to ensure transportability between C
compilers under UNIX  which  don't  recognize  exactly  the  same
operator  precidence.   Additionally,  2.9 has much more internal
documentation on the ARPA Net interface.

        Concerning interfacing to the ARPA Net, it's beginning to
look like a general-purpose interface is not possible.  There are
simply too many differences in the  various  versions  of  SERVER
TELNET  floating  around out there.  Hence, I'm beginning to feel
that each user is going to have to be left to his own devices  to
get the ARPA Net interface to work (sorry).  Any comments?

MADDOX@MIT-ML 08/31/81 22:11:03 Re: MBOOT and D.C. Hayes - problems
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-ML
Although MBOOT has the proper equates, and the code looks ok, my D.C. Hayes
Micromodem 100, running under CP/M 2.2 on a Cromemco Z-2 system is not working.

The symptom:  It prints the header & all that, goes into the terminal mode
and sits there.  cold.  It wakes up when I give it an ESC or ^E and does
the appropriate thing.  It seems that it's not talking to the modem.

I'm running the modem control program supplied by the Hayes people to do the
dialing and initialization of the modem, then branching to MBOOT.  I am sure
that the modem's state is not changed during this transition.

SOMEBODY must have used MBOOT on a D.C. Hayes - how did you do it?

Thanks so much for your help.


MADLER@MIT-ML 08/30/81 16:24:37 Re: locating sectors with the BIOS on a H/Z89
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-ML
Having just completed an interrupt driven MODEM program for use in normal
communications and file transfer (for computers without special dumping
software) I have come across a problem with interrupt driven character
input while performing disk operations on a Heathkit H89 using Heath's
CP/M.  In the BIOS, subroutine LPS (locate proper sector) disables interrupts,
thus causing dropped characters.  Does anybody know whether or not interrupts
are disabled simply to eliminate interference by the 2ms clock or is timing
critical and interference by any process would cause problems.  If
only the former is true, I could modify this subroutine to turn off the
2ms clock and maintain other interrupts.  If it is the latter, I may have
to suffer from dropped characters!

Also, has anybody modified Heathkit's CP/M BIOS successfully?  I tried once
but their instructions were sparse and seemed not to apply.  If anybody could
describe exactly how the BIOS is modified and then how a new system disk
is created I would really appreciate it!!!

Thanks,

Subject:  Call for advice and info on the Apple/CPM/Amethyst connection
To: INFO-APPLE at MIT-AI, AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI, INFO-CPM at MIT-AI,
    INFO-MICRO at MIT-AI

Dear Apple users, Amethyst users, and CPM people,
   I am a new owner of an Apple II plus, and would appreciate help and
advice from more experienced users. My questions break down into 2 
groups: (1) questions concerning the system I hope to build
around my Apple, and (2) general questions about things I don't 
understand yet. 

My sincere apologies for both the length of this inquiry, and the
redundancy to many of you who are on more than one of the mailing lists.
My thanks for your patience and your help.

BACKGROUND:
	Things I would like to do with my Apple:
		Text editing (writing papers, reports, and student evaluations)
		Programming (my previous experience is with LISP and LOGO)
		Teach my wife programming in LOGO
		Games and Puzzles (Sargon chess, backgammon, various "arcade games")
		Graphics hacking / art work
		Terminal dial up to larger systems (Cyber and Vax in Amherst
			area, and MIT-AI if I can obtain an inexpensive connection
			from Northampton-- this latter would be especially 
			helpful to me)
		LISP programming and perhaps even some of my thesis research (AI)
	    (i am unsure as to the feasibility of some of these things and would
		appreciate your disabusing me of any unrealistic fantasies)

	My current system consists of:
		48k Apple II plus
		Apple disk drive (5.25 in.) with DOS 3.3
		Epson MX-80 printer
		Home color TV (19" with SupRMod modulator)

FANTASY SYSTEM:
    The following is the tentative plan I have for expanding my system.
It is driven largely by my desire to run the AMETHYST software (MINCE 
and SCRIBBLE).
	SOFTCARD Z80 with CPM (so as to be able to run MINCE, etc.)
	80 column, upper/lower case display
	2nd disk drive (5.25 in.)
	16k RAMCARD (to extend to 64k)
	modem
	(color monitor?)
	
QUESTIONS ON SYSTEM EXPANSION:

0. Is my "fantasy system" feasible? That is, WILL IT WORK??
   I am especially anxious to learn of any interaction effects
   or incompatibilities of pieces of the system I am considering.
   Are there components or angles I've overlooked? 

1. Will there be enough slots to put it all together (i count 6)? 
   Will some of them be wanting to go in the same slot?
   Will the Apple heat up and/or explode with all those boards plugged in??
   If so, is it a solution to remove the power supply to outside the Apple
   casing? Would a good fan be adequate to do the job?

2. Is it worth the bother (and expense). I think I can scrounge up
   the money, but will I be reasonably satisfied with the final result
   or will I have only an expensive kludge?

3. Has anyone already tried a similar system? I would be EXTREMELY
   INTERESTED in corresponding with you to learn how it worked out!!

4. Are people happy with the Amethyst package? What are peoples' experiences
   with MINCE and SCRIBBLE on the Apple? How does SCRIBBLE fare when
   combined with the Epson MX-80?

5. Are there radical alternatives I should consider before committing
   myself further to this project? (eg. selling the Apple and building
   or acquiring an alternative system?) How serious a constraint is the
   8 bit processor and 64k address space?? 

6. Any specific recommendations or warnings regarding alternative hardware
   (such as 80 column boards, 16k ram cards, and modems)? In particular
   I am curious as to which (if any) of the 80 column boards would impose the
   least drain on the power supply? 

7. Will a home tv provide adequate resolution for 80 column upper/lower
   case display? How much additional resolution would I get from a color
   monitor (for both text and graphics)?

8. Do ALL the 80 column boards automatically provide upper/lower case display?
   (I'm currently inclined toward the Videx Videoterm)

9. Is the Videx Keyboard Enhancer redundant with the Videoterm board?
   (if not, is it a reasonable way to upgrade the keyboard?)
   What is the best way for me to obtain keyboard entry of upper/lower case
   and other ascii characters (preferably using the shift key)??

10. What should I look for in a modem? Is the Hayes Micromodem II everything
   its cracked up to be? Are there reasonable 1200 baud modems for the
   Apple?

11. Will Apple Pascal software run on the alternative 16k ram boards (Andromeda,
	Microsoft RAMCARD, etc.)? Would I really want Apple Pascal anyway?

12. Does anyone have experience with any of the "friction feed" add-ons for
   the MX-80 (such as Orange Micro's, or the one advertised for $15)? 
   What about the dot graphics updrade (do I correctly recall they claimed
   this will also provide italic fonts?)?

13. How can I get the best prices on equipment I purchase? Are mail order
   houses generally reliable, or are some of them fly-by-nighters that may
   take my money and run? Are there ways I can get wholesale prices on
   single quantity (I expect I'm dreaming, but it can't hurt to ask).

14. Is service a big issue with micro-computer ownership? (I've only had my
   system for 3 weeks now). Should I be wary of Mail Order houses on this
   account?

GENERAL INFORMATIONAL QUESTIONS:

1. Could some kind and patient soul please explain to me what is involved
   in Up and Down Loading? I understand (i think) that they have to do
   with shipping files (or is it just programs? -- please clarify) back
   and forth between micros and mainframes. Are the problems primarily due
   to differences in word size? or are there other more subtle issues that
   I can't imagine?

2. Has anyone developed a central catalog of software purchased or written
   by various people who would be willing to share their resources?

3. Any suggestions as to my best means for hooking into MIT-AI from the
   Northampton/Amherst area? Can I do network hopping through any commercial
   networks at reasonable prices? Are long distance phone lines reliable
   for transmitting information, or are they too noisy? Any and all suggestions
   will be gratefully accepted (and shared with our own Dave McDonald (DDM) who
   is also located in Amherst).

4. Can one get away with "turning over" diskettes and using the other side?
   One can cut out a second "write enable" hole, and store things on both
   sides of a diskette. Is there any danger of information bleed-through
   from using both sides simultaneously for storage?? Does the risk become
   greater as the disk surfaces wear away??

Thank you again for your patience and help. My apologies for this inordinately
long message. I'm very anxious to get on as quickly as possible to expanding
my system, but I'd like to benefit from all your prior experiences.
Apologies also for the redundancy entailed in my sending this to the several
"micro" mailing lists.

Subject: Diskette library control
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC


The following was left on my RCPM system.  I don't normally
forward long messages to a mailing list like this one, but
felt this one was of such universal interest it was worth
making an exception.

LIBRARY.CTL   Microcomputer Diskette Library Control.

04/25/81.     T. McCormick.


	Control  of computer libraries is well developed in large 
computer  operations.  Only  tiny operations can get  by  without 
specific  rules for naming programs and data  files,  segregating 
test files from production, indicating as-of dates, etc.

	With the rapid growth of microcomputer use,  and with the 
continual improvement in disk storage capacity per  dollar,  many 
business  and  hobby users are discovering that with  no  library 
plan,  too  much time and effort are wasted looking for the right 
version, starting to run the wrong version...again, etc.

	It  is  possible  to acquire and  store  more  files  and 
programs than you can manage without some library system.

	Micro operating systems,  editors, and utilities offer an 
occasional  assist  in one way or another such as  creating  .BAK 
backup  file copies automatically.   But the user is left to  put 
his  library control scheme together by himself.  He often  lacks 
the  experience  which comes from years of grappling  with  these 
problems,  and  is  forced to discover solutions one at  a  time.  
This results in a weak start, and continual change.

	I have made many mistakes related to computer  libraries, 
and  have  seen many others.   As computer center manager  for  a 
nationwide accounting firm, we daily were working with files from 
all kinds of outside program libraries.   I would like to pass on 
a  few suggestions based on my experience with about 300 computer 
libraries over an eleven year period.

	The following is not intended as a exact prescription for 
you,  you will have to decide what fits,  and what doesn't.  I'll 
use  my library control methods as an example,  knowing that  you 
will have to adapt it to your circumstances.

	Here is a summary of important rules:

	1.  Never alter a "distribution" diskette in any  way.  A 
distribution  diskette is one you receive from someone else,  and 
for which you usually have paid money.   You may have to send  it 
back  to get a new release at the "update" price rather than  buy 
another  license!   You may not be able to read it next year  and 
you  want a fresh copy at nominal charge.  You may want to get  a 
bug fixed at no charge.  Do NOT change anything on this diskette. 
N O T H I N G . 

	2.  A program that is one bit, one byte, or one statement 
different  from another MUST have a different name.   There is no 
such thing as	"same as....,  except".  Resist the temptation to 
leave the names the same when they are "only slightly" different.  
Subtle differences are hard to sort out six months later!  Subtle 
differences may be much harder to find than large differences  or 
gross errors.

	3. Follow your system rigidly.

	4. Label things immediately, while they are fresh in your 
mind.  Little peel-off dots and labels are inexpensive,  and easy 
to use.  Office supply stores have a rainbow assortment (Avery is 
one  of the brand names) and they are cheap.   Color  coding  can 
segregate  test from permanent files,  release 2 from release  3, 
etc. without any writing.

	5.   Begin  library  control  at  once:  it  gets  harder 
geometrically as you acquire more stuff.

	6.  When you initialize/format a diskette,  place a small 
peel-off  label  (I  use  one-inch  dots  on  it  indicating  the 
operating system version you used, date, and density or format if 
you have more than one. Eventually, you will have more than one.

	7.  Specifically  label backup copies,  and write-protect 
them.  Store them separately from daily-use diskettes. Store them 
inside,  where the humidity and temperature are fairly  constant. 
Exchange  backup storage with another user,  if you can.  Do  not 
store diskettes or cassettes in your car trunk!

	Why bother with backup?   Have you ever entered 

	A>ERA *.*     instead of    A>ERA B:*.*    or

	A>PIP A:=B:*.*[V]  instead of
	      B:=A:*.*[V]

	HUMMMM?

	You say you're not that stupid??   OK.


	8.   Establish  categories,   and  label  your  diskettes 
accordingly.	For example, Proprietary software such as MBASIC, 
CP/M, etc could be replaced by a dealer.  Your modifications, and 
custom programs could not.  They should be protected to a greater 
degree.

	9. Never keep all your backup in one place. Two suitcases 
ten  miles  apart  is  more secure  than  one  bomb-proof  vault.  
Remember, with all the electrical equipment in one computer room, 
a  small  fire could destroy alot of diskettes in a  hurry.   Bet 
you've got 'em stored close by so they'll be nice and handy too!

       10.  Data-file diskettes change periodically.  Use a peel-
off label to indicate clearly the filenames,  and as-of date.  Do 
not  store  backup  of  data files on  the  same  diskette  under 
different filenames.  Diskettes can become unusable no matter how 
careful you are.

       11. I recognize three flavors of diskettes:
		a. never used.
		b. initialized/formatted, not used.
		c. in use, contains one or more files.

Come  up with a scheme to indicate each of these.  I do not put a 
peel-off file label on never-used diskettes.  If I see a diskette 
with  no  peel-off  label  at  all,   I  know  it  has  not  been 
initialized/formatted.   When I initialize/format a  diskette,  I 
place  a  one-inch  colored dot on it  indicating  the  operating 
system  version,  today's date,  and the recording format/density 
with  which it was initialized/formatted.  Such diskettes have  a 
directory,  but  do not have any files.  Every diskette  of  mine 
which  contains a file has a large peel-off label indicating  the 
name(s),  or something else indicative such as "SYSTEM",  "WORK", 
"MBASIC", etc.

	Never  write  on a distribution copy,...the diskette  you 
received from someone else.  If you alter such a diskette in  any 
way, you usually void any warranty. Do not add to it, delete from 
it,  or rename anything.  Do not even write a .DOC file, a volume 
serial  number,  or  anything else on it.   You should  label  it 
"DISTRIB", and make a complete fresh copy from which to work.  If 
you have to send it back for an update to the next release, or to 
get a bug fixed,  or because you can't read it anymore,  etc. you 
can not expect the people you got it from to listen to your story 
of how "..it's exactly like when you sent it to me,  except....". 
It  is  bound  to  cost you money sooner or later  if  you  alter 
distribution diskettes.

Since you will not be altering them,  you must count on  peel-off 
labels to identify your distribution diskette contents, etc. 

		A. Apply a peel-off label saying
		   "DISTRIB".

		B. Write the date received on that
		   label.

		C. Write protect the diskette.

		D. Make your working copy from which
		   you will begin tailoring.
		   Clearly label this copy.
		   I call mine "DISTCOPY".

		E. Make a 2nd copy of valuable stuff
		   for an off-site location. This
		   might be your office, or another
		   user. It should NOT be your car
		   trunk, or other outside storage.
		   Humidity will ruin your diskettes.

		F. Store the "DISTRIB" diskette with
		   other "DISTRIB" diskettes, not with
		   the working copies of that system.
		   Physically separate backup copies
		   from those you use daily.


	Now that we have secured your distribution diskette,  and 
made  a working copy,  we are ready to tackle one of the cruelest 
problems in using a computer.  Give some thought to the NAMES you 
apply to programs in the process of being changed.

	One  scheme is to add a "suffix" to the filename,  or  to 
change the filetype to .001  .002  etc.

	You  want to keep some consistency so that the names  are 
meaningful,  and wildcards can be used with utilities   (example:  
PIP  B:=C:PROGM???.BAS[V]).   But  you  must  name  your  changes 
differently  from the distribution filename,  and from your other 
changes. How will you know which is your latest version? How will 
you know which is your latest version which works?

	It  is a mistake to count on keeping the  same  filename, 
and using different diskettes.  The trend is rapidly toward large 
capacity,  non-removeable hard disks.   In a few years,  everyone 
will  have  5 or 10 MB disks!  Anyway,  it is easier to  learn  a 
disciplined approach,  and follow it,  than to spend alot of time 
making  gobs  of  filecopies and then trying to  remember  what's 
what.

	If  you begin changing a program called  BUDGET.BAS,  you 
might  call your first  modification  BUDGET01.BAS,  BUDGET1.BAS, 
BUDGET.001, BUD1.BAS, B1.BAS etc. It is a matter of taste, and of 
how large your library is.   The larger it is,  the more specific 
you have to be...you might have more than one budget program.  If 
you  have an editor,  and you save the basic program as an  ASCII 
file  (ie.  SAVE "B:BUDGET01.ASC",A),  you may want to adopt  the 
.ASC  filetype naming convention to clearly identify it as  ready 
for your editor, or to be modemed to another user.  Be aware that 
some operating systems have a limit of six character names.

	As  you  modify  programs,  add remarks in the  front  to 
indicate  the as-of date,  version,  etc.  Professional  programs 
display this information as they are read in to be executed:  for 
example,  note  how MBASIC clearly identifies it's  version/date.  
In  that  way,  the  user knows from looking at the  CRT  if  the 
correct version of the program has been loaded. Many programs are 
dependant  on  the  release/version  of  the  operating   system. 
Unfortunately,  the  program names often do not change,  but  the 
programs  are  different.  Some will not run with  new  releases. 
Peel-off  labels  will help with this  problem  also:  ie.   "1.4 
depen", etc.

	After  you have migrated to a new release/version of your 
operating system,  a new set of problems appear.  Programs  which 
used to work,  now do not. You may have to rename some of them if 
you  are  going  to  retain old  versions  (everyone  does).  For 
example, you may want to rename CLIST to CLIST15 or CLIST16 if it 
runs  on ver 1.5 or 1.6.  Then you can use CLIST for  the  latest 
version.  This  approach  requires  you to rename a  lot  of  OLD 
programs  that do not run on new releases.   I prefer this to the 
next  method because I do not mix much among different  versions. 
If I did, I would do as below.

	Another approach (please do not mix this with the  above) 
is  to  identify  the release in the name  (CL15  or  CL16),  and 
perhaps shorten the names at the same time.   But this starts you 
talking a "different language" than the documentation,  and other 
users.  You  have to translate their conversations to your naming 
scheme.  If  you  are bright and independent,  or  shorten  names 
anyway,  then this has the advantage of avoiding a lot of  donkey 
work  at  conversion time.....you rename on your working copy  of 
the DISTRIB diskette,  and then PIP them as you go along.  You do 
not have to go back and rename a dozen copies of every program.

	There  is no right or wrong way;  it is a matter of  your 
style.   Remember though,  you can't avoid the work.  It's just a 
matter of when and how you prefer to do it.   I prefer NOT to mix 
different  releases if I have a choice.   I would rather generate 
entire new diskettes for the new release.   In this way,  I  have 
complete diskettes to go back to if I want (or need) to.  No half 
this,  and  half  that.   I avoid having to flip something  on  a 
diskette  to tell it which flavor I want to run.  If you get very 
many of these "switches" on a diskette, it is a long process just 
to  find out where your beginning from!   I make specific  copies 
and  label  them  as  to options in  effect  on  that  particular 
diskette.  Saves me time and nerves.

	I hope one or two of these ideas are helpful.  Good luck.

Hi --

        UMODEM Version 2.8 is now at MC under CPM;UMODEM C.  This
version  corrects  a  reference  to  a  system-dependent variable
TIOCSSCR for Version 7 users -- this reference is for those  sys-
tems  which  have  page  mode  installed,  and by default this is
flagged out.  By setting the PAGEMODE flag to TRUE the  user  can
flag this ioctl call back in.

        Version 2.8 also supports TERM II FTP 4 now  ...  looking
good!   This  is invoked by the 4 option; FTP 4 is not present in
TERM II, Version 4.7, but it  will  be  in  Version  4.8  (to  be
released  in the near future).  No problems have been reported to
me yet concerning TERM II, and  Version  4.8  is  an  enhancement
only.

        Enjoy!

Conversation today with Hewlett-Packard revealed that disk incompatibility
problem for cp/m with HP-125 is due to very rapid reading of HP disk drive.
Result is that disks written by HP-125 in "IBM format" can be read by
other cp/m systems capable of reading standard single-density cp/m disks, but
disks written by these other systems not readable by HP-125.  HP's
position on this is that they advertised the machine as cp/m compatable,
and it will be.  The HP division making the disk drives has been working
on the problem for a couple of weeks and have two solutions that work
so far.  They will pick the best one and then retrofit it to existing
units and correct new ones.  No dates given, but impression is that
fix will be available within next couple of weeks.

Subject:   UMODEM Version 2.7

Hi, Everyone,

        The latest version of UMODEM is now available  on  MIT-MC
under  CPM.  Its name is CPM;UMODEM C [I decided to keep only the
current version at MIT-MC].

        Thanks TONS to Bennett  Marks  for  his  transportability
conversion to UNIX Version 7 (his release is UMODEM Version 2.6).
I think he did a superior job!  This new UMODEM (Version 2.7)  is
an  enhancement of his upgrade.  To compile it for your UNIX sys-
tem, the following command lines are recommended:

cc -7 umodem.c -o umodem -DJHU  <-- for JHU UNIX
cc -7 umodem.c -o umodem -DVER7 <-- for Version 7 UNIX (I'm not sure -7 is
                                        required)

        Version 2.7 includes the Version 7 UNIX transportability,
a  status  option  (y)  which  gives  the user file size and CP/M
record count information for his up/down loading  time  estimate,
and  a  7-bit  transmission option (7) which masks out the MSB of
either protocol (TERM II FTP 1 or FTP 3 [CP/M  UG  Protocol])  so
that  a  modified MODEM2 or TERM II can transceive text files via
UMODEM on the ARPA Net.  The ARPA Net problems (bah, humbug!) are
still not resolved, but I'm working on them.

        Enjoy, and thanks for all the interest!

Re:   CHEAP FORTRAN AND MACRO 80 PROGRAMS

If you want a copy of the Microsoft F80 and M80 programs
as well as their support software and you want to get them
with free updates for a year and be a legal user read on.
While not free, Heathkit sells these programs, doctored up
so they only run on Heath systems, at a discount.  The
discount is quite steep and the free updates are attractive.
You will need to know about DDT and SAVE to fix them so you
can use them:

FOR FORTRAN: >DDT F80.COM
then alter the LXI d,barf at 2C38 to jmp 2C90.
Exit from DDT and do a SAVE 107 F80.COM

FOR MACRO80: >DDT M80.COM
then alter the LXI d,barf at 4392 to jmp 43EA.
Exit from DDT and do a SAVE 75 M80.COM

You now own legal copies of both programs suitable for use
on your CP/M 1.4 or 2.2 system.

This patch bypasses the vendor code check in the CP/M
serial number and also bypasses some I/O twitching that
must be important for Heath systems.  The other system
programs distibuted on the disk do not need patching
these programs (LIB, L80 XREF etc) assume if you got to
use them you must be ok.

The same patch is probably possible in other Heath
software such as BASIC Compiler or COBOL Compiler.  I
have not researched these programs however.

My advice to fix other software would be to look at the
area in which the vendor code check is being carried out
and follow the same bypass as I did in M80.

Lots of Luck - Happy Computing from us at NSI.

Re:   TYPESQ version 1.3 now available

TYPESQ version 1.2 (previously called TYPESQ2), the program for typing
"squeezed" ASCII files, has been updated as of today (thanks to Bob
Mathias).  TYPESQ2 was printing CR-CR-LF when it came to a CR-LF in
the file.  This has been corrected, and a message has been added to
the 40 and 80 character limited versions to tell when the limit has
been exceeded.  The previous versions simply stopped printing.

New version 1.3 .COM files:

--> FILE:  TYPSQ40A.COM		CRC = 5B A9	<--limit 40 lines

--> FILE:  TYPSQ80A.COM		CRC = 3B 10	<--limit 80 lines

--> FILE:  TYPESQ13.COM		CRC = 52 C5


Source code for new version 1.3:

--> FILE:  TYPESQ13.C  		CRC = D1 9C

--> FILE:  SPCLDIO .C  		CRC = C5 DC



	  TYPESQ.DOC as of 7/6/81
   by Bob Mathias and Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

TYPESQ.COM is a program primarily for use on remote
CP/M systems to allow typing "squeezed" files.  It
does not accept wild cards, but will accept multiple
file names on the command line, separated by spaces.
The output to the console is "filtered" (like MLIST)
to eliminate control characters other than CR, LF,
TAB, or FORMFEED.

TYPESQ is based on USQ by Richard Greenlaw, and was
written by Bob Mathias, with suggestions from Keith
Petersen.

Subject:   UMODEM Version 2.5

Hi, Everyone,

        The version of UMODEM on MIT-MC is 2.5 --  two  things  I
should clarify about it:

        1.  It is written to run under UNIX Version  6.12x  (JHU-
UNIX, specifically).  To convert to some other UNIX (say, Version
7), the system-dependent features  are  referenced  in  comments.
JHU-UNIX-specific  references are made, and system-dependent con-
stants are noted by SD in a comment with  them.   Also,  UMODEM.C
was compiled with the Version 7 option on the UNIX C compiler.

        2.  The ARPA Net interface isn't sound yet.  This is  en-
gaged with the 'a' option (see the internal documentation).  Some
TIPs don't configure themselves correctly and I believe there  is
still  some problem with the commands I issue to SERVER TELNET in
general.  Any help from an ARPA Net hacker on these matters would
be  greatly  appreciated.   I  am  using the WILL, WONT, IAC, DO,
DONT, etc, stuff, but I  don't  think  I'm  using  it  completely
correctly; also, the 'a' option traps out IAC references (FF Hex)
by doubling them, so I caught that problem.  Thanks  specifically
to GZ for her help in such matters.

        Any help with the ARPA Net interface would be greatly ap-
preciated.

80.  Has anyone tried paralleling the Pwr and Reset switches to the
front panel or even moving them physically from the rear panel to the
front.  They are heck to get to in standard computer furniture.

Also, I made an extension cable for the baud rate header with an
8-positon DIP switch wired direct to cable which works just fine.
This gives me 4 baud rates for each of the 2 serial ports.  Then I
made another cable with the switch pluggable to the cable via two
wire-wrap sockets.  I cannot get it to work altho it checks out
perfectly with a continuity checker.  Has anyone had any experience
with such an animal.  I've tried both a short (10") and a long (24")
cable, and neither work -- my original cable was about 18".  I've
swapped switches and cables -- I've done everything but rewire the
sockets, which is my last resort.  Any ideas?

This cable is extremely handy if one is switching rt. & left ports,
devices, modems, or whatever -- saves pulling off the case and
inserting a new header each time.

Subject: Static RAM info

The following is forwarded from my RCPM system:

STAT-RAM.DOC:  Prices and Capabilities of Recent S-100 Static RAM Boards

                              Ben Bronson, HP/RCPM
                              312-955-4493, 8/5/81

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talking  with one of the people at a local computer store the  other  day 
made me realize that many, including professionals, have not been keeping 
track of the recent dramatic increases in static RAM capabilities and the 
equally dramatic drops in prices.  

Most  of us are used to paying about $300 for an assembled and tested  S-
100  l6k static board.   While traditional prices for dynamic RAM  boards 
have not been a lot less in 16K configurations, we are also accustomed to 
a 2:1 price advantage of dynamic over static in 32K and larger configura
tions.

Now,  no  one disputes that static RAMs are a lot less temperamental when 
it comes time to put a new board into a computer and boot the machine up.  
Statics have many fewer timing problems,  and tend to run faster,  hotter 
and, some think, more reliably.  These advantages have made many computer 
users willing to pay the 2:1 premium for static rather than dynamic  RAM.  
Altough  they have generally believed that dynamic RAMs were the wave  of 
the future, they have gone on buying static and waiting.

But  the situation now seems to have taken an unexpected  twist.   Almost 
unnoticed  by  many  experts,  statics are undergoing a  strong  revival, 
especially in the S-100 field.  The market has suddenly been flooded with 
offerings of new,  ultra-high capacity static boards which are (1) relat-
ively cheap,  (2) compatible with almost all processors and disk control-
lers, and (3) very fast indeed.

Static  boards  now run at twice the speed of any  dynamic  board.   Many 
static brands are fully compatible with the new IEEE S-100 standard; even 
the most recent and expensive dynamic brands rarely are.   And the  price 
differential  has  declined so far that one can often find static  boards 
that are actually cheaper than equivalent dynamic boards.

This  situation is not reflected in the inventory of the average  dealer, 
who  still may have boxes full of memory boards bought last year and  who 
may not have made recent price comparisons anyway.   The following  table 
is  therefore  offered  as a aid to both dealers and their  customers  in 
deciding what to stock, recommend, and/or buy.   This writer's feeling is 
that  the  table  gives good reasons for insisting on  recent  models  of 
static  memory boards in all cases except when the main consideration  is 
to have massive amounts of memory (128k, 254k or 512k) on a single board.  
Static  boards of 1979-1980 vintage,  with 16k at @ $300,  should not  be 
bought.   Famous-name dynamic boards offered at similar prices should  be 
laughed off the market.

The  data  in the table was extracted from advertisements in  the  August 
1981  issue of Byte.   Omissions should generally be interpreted as nega-
tives or as specs the manufacturer is not proud of.   Positive statements 
about included features should of course be taken with a grain of salt.

without IEEE-S100 compatibility,  bank selection, extended addressing, or 
ability to run with DMA) sells for $180 for 16k and $360 for 64k, and the 
fancier  ones  (i.e.,  Systems Group with "IEEE compatible timing" but  a

MADLER@MIT-ML 08/09/81 23:32:56 Re: LST: spooling
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-ML
I am in the process of writing a line printer spooler for an H89 on
CP/M 2.2.  Everything has been working perfectly UNTIL one situation
occurs.  If I am performing some task that requires a disk operation
and a disk head is loaded when the spooler attempts to read from
a disk simultaneously, the system crashes.

I have gone so far as to save the old DMA value before I move it around
with the spooler.  Thus, that is NOT the problem.  Does anybody have
any ideas on how to avoid the problem.  I suppose that if some status
bit somewhere indicated that a disk operation was occuring I could
cause the spooler to wait.  But, since I am using interrupts, I am not
sure that I could actually have the spooler return to the old process
until that process had finished with the disk.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I could handle this problem?

Thanks,

	However, you absolutely must have a z-80 cpu to use their
controller (the firmware supplied with the CCS controller has z-80

Subject:   Ithaca

Hi, Lauren,

        The documentation on the Ithaca Z80 card I am use  CLAIMS
to  be fully compatable with the IEEE S-100 standard.  The 20 ad-
dress bits (1M byte addressing) is what is supported by this card
directly,  and it simply lets the high-order 4 bits go low (actu-
ally claims to force them low).

        I have used this processor with a number of different  S-
100  boards  from  different  manufacturers  and have had no real
trouble.  About the only board I couldn't get it to work with was
the  Morrow Designs 8" disk controller (both Rev A and B) running
CP/M 2.2 with the Morrow Designs' BIOS (strangely, this runs fine
with  CP/M 1.4 with the Morrow Designs' BIOS); I don't place much
emphasis on this problem,  because  I  have  tried  these  Morrow
Designs  disk controllers with a number of Z80 CPU cards and have
found CP/M 2.2 to work well with the California Computer  Systems
Z80  card  only  (Ithaca Z80, Vector Graphic Z80, and a couple of
others were tried).  Morrow Designs CP/M 2.2 seems to  work  well
with all the 8080 CPU cards I've tried, however.

Subject:   Re:  hard/soft sectored floppy formats

Alan,

        I have been faced with a similar problem before, and have
come  up  with  a software-based alternative which seems to solve
the problem.  In my particular environment, I have the capability
of  transferring  the  files  on  hard-sectored North Star 5 1/4"
single-density disks to  soft-sectored  8"  single-density  (CP/M
standard) and double-density disks.

        Now for the bad news ... I'm using two microcomputer sys-
tems  to  do  this.  They are linked by a 9600-baud RS-232 serial
communications  channel,  and  I  am  running  my   commercially-
available  TERM II/XTERM programs to do the transfer.  You can do
a similar thing with the public domain MODEM2/XMODEM programs  or
other programs which support a file transfer facility.

        This environment can be pictured as follows:

CRT <---> TERM II or MODEM2 Microcomputer <--> XTERM or XMODEM
          with 8" disks                         Microcomputer
                                                with 5 1/4" disks

        The steps for transferring a file are as follows:

                1.  Turn on both computers and boot  up  CP/M  on
each.   The 9600-baud serial link to the TERM II microcomputer is
the default console for the XTERM microcomputer.

                2.  Run TERM II and select the modem going to the
desired  XTERM  microcomputer.  Link to this and communicate with
it in terminal (transparent) mode; from this mode, you can  issue
normal CP/M commands as though you were directly connected to the
XTERM microcomputer.

                3.  Run XTERM and specify the file  you  want  to
work with (file name as it exists or is to exist on the XTERM mi-
crocomputer) and whether you want to send it from XTERM  to  TERM
II or receive it on the XTERM system from the TERM II system.

                4.  Return to TERM II, specify the file name  for
the  TERM  II  system (may be different from the XTERM name), and
specify to TERM II whether it is to receive (XTERM is sending) or
send  (XTERM is receiving) the file.  At this point, the two sys-
tems will synchronize and transfer the file data  with  automatic
error detection and retry (in packets) between them.

        If  you  have  two  such  systems  with  the  appropriate
software  (CP/M  and  a communications package), you can transfer
between virtually any two disk formats you  desire  provided  you
have  the  controller hardware to support the desired formats.  I
hope this helps.

For what it's worth, I have an older Ithaca Audio Z80 cpu in my system
and I don't care for it at all... it has given me considerable trouble.

Can we assume from the fact that the new Z80 card offers 20M addressing that
it differs from the 696 standard in other ways as well?

David,

        I have not seen the flyer you refer to, but I DO  own  an
Ithaca  Intersystems DPS-1 mainframe.  I feel that this is an ex-
cellent supporting mainframe whose outstanding features include:

                . 20 slot terminated IEEE S-100 motherboard
                . large, reliable power supply (8V at 30A)
                . full front panel with the following features:
                        - memory examine/examine next
                        - memory deposit/deposit next
                        - instruction CYCLE single step
			- instruction CYCLE slow step
			  (adjustable speed)
                        - hardware breakpoint when a
                          specified data byte encountered
                        - hardware breakpoint when a

                        - run/stop
                        - many test points for hardware debugging
                . Ithaca Z80 CPU Card:
                        - supports 20-bit (1M byte) addressing
                          [IEEE S-100 supports 24 bits (16M byte)]
                        - full on-board interrupt controller
                        - many options for configuring processor
                          for specific applications
                        - full DMA is supported

        The features you described in your message,  namely  disk
blocking and deblocking and interrupt-driven I/O, can be support-
ed by this hardware, but they must be  implemented  in  the  CP/M
BIOS  software.   I  am  quite  pleased with the hardware and its
quality of design, but I do not run their CP/M on my  system  and
do not have these more exotic features implemented.

Subject: disk formats
To: info-cpm at ai

A similar question to the one put forth by RAMAG -- well, sortof.

I'd like to know how system/directory tracks are set up in CP/M for
nonstandard disk sizes and formats.

For example, standard CP/M on an 8inch disk:

tracks 0,1 --- system
track 2: blocks 0 and 1 (1024 byte blocks) --- directory

Now, what about other systems?  How about double density 8 inch?
Single and double density 5 1/4 inch?  Northstar?  H89 5 1/4?
Apple with Softcard?  TRS-80?  What happens with odd sector sizes?
Are 1024 byte blocks always used internally by CP/M?

And what ARE the differences between regular CP/M and CP/M running on 
the softcard?

Does anyone have a table or document (or just KNOW) how to translate
(software-wise) between these various system and disk formats?

Thanks.

Subject: hard/soft sectored floppy formats
To:   info-cpm at MIT-AI

I have an application where I need to translate disks from different
soft-sectored and hard-sectored floppy disk formats to standard cp/m.
There was a controller advertised in BYTE that claimed to be able to
do this: the Omega controller by Sirius Systems of Knoxville, TN.
Unfortunately, their phone is disconnected, so they probably ceased.
(They don't answer letters either!)

TI has announced a new generalized controller chip that should
do the job, but it's too new to be in a product yet.

Does anyone know of any other product or approach that might work?
As a last resort, I might have to commission a custom design using the TTI
chip, but I would by far rather deal with a standard S-100 product.
If I can't do it with one general-purpose controller, then I would use
a separate controller for the hard-sectored formats--but I haven't seen
an s-100 board for controlling only hard-sectored floppies either.

Hope someone can help!

I recently called NEC to find out about pricing and availability of the
uPD7220 Graphics Display Controller Chip.  According to them, the GDC
will be available by the end of this month.  Unfortunately, the price
of this chip in small quantities is rather steep (about $150 for quantity
1-9), so the best alternative is to place a larger group order, taking
advantage of a quantity discount.  If a total of ten chips are ordered, for
example, the price drops to about $120 per chip.

that lets you change disks but it seems CMP out foxes us by detecting
that a disk has been changed and gives a R/O error.

Is there a way to notify CPM that a disk is being changed etc.  Better
yet, is there a single drive file and disk copy routine around that I
could look at?

   SQ/USQ/FLS/TYPESQ file update notice - 7/22/81
	 by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

This is a list of CRCs for the latest SQ/USQ/FLS files,
obtained from Richard Greenlaw (the author) on 7/22/81.
Also included are the new versions of TYPESQ from Bob
Mathias (the author) on 7/22/81.

Some of the programs have been updated. This will require
replacement of some of the previously-released files,
including USQ.COM, USQ.C, CHANGES.DOC, README.DOC, and
TYPESQ.COM.

A new user's manual, SQUEEZER.DOC, is now included
(this replaces BUILDSQ.DOC and gives complete operating
instructions and theory).

Check your copies with CRCK.  The files with a "Q" as the
middle letter of the filetype are squeezed versions of the
originals.  You don't need these to compile - you need the
un-squeezed versions.  To save disk space and modeming time,
some systems may offer only the squeezed versions.  You can
restore those by running USQ on them.

Please note that SQDIO and USQDIO are not supplied because
they are identical to DIO2 and can be created with PIP.

Subject: New version of TYPESQ
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

TYPESQ.COM, the program for typing "squeezed" ASCII files,
has been updated as of today (thanks to RJM@MC).  The original
version of TYPESQ.COM did not stop when it came to the first 1Ah
in the last sector of the file.  If the file was not filled to
the end with 1A's, it would print whatever "garbage" was left
in that sector.  The new version corrects this.

Also available for RCPM operators are two other versions of
the new TYPESQ, one which limits the maximum number of lines
that can be typed to 40, the other to 80.  This is to discourage
RCPM users from spending too much time on the system typing
long files, thus denying others the use of the system.  These
limited versions tell the user to please use XMODEM for full
transfers.  (Reasoning: typing a file takes much longer than
XMODEMing it because the TABs are expanded).

The new files are on MC
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ 40COM
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ 80COM
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ ALLCOM

No source code is available at this time.  Watch for
announcement later.

	Since the documentation on the Mod 2 TRS-80 does not bother
to discuss hardware, the following port addresses and equates for
MODEM.ASM programs might prove useful to anyone using this machine:

	MODCTLP	EQU	0F6H	;status/control port A

	MODSNDR	EQU	04H	;  with the bit set to 1

	MODRCVR	EQU	01H	;  with the bit set to 1
	MODDATP	EQU	0F4H	;data port A

	These values, plugged into MODEM.ASM, allow the TRS-80 Mod 2 to
function without any special system calls or other variations from the
existing MODEM.ASM program, assuming the port has been set up using the
SETUP (Pickles & Trout's CPM), CONFIG (Lifeboat's CPM) or SET (Cybernetics'

I received the following file on my remote CP/M system yesterday
and thought all here would find it of interest.

	    OSBORNE.DOC   -   FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
	       OF THE OSBORNE I MICROCOMPUTER

	  --------------------------------------------

     The wait is finally over!	We  received our  demonstra-
tion unit of the Osborne I  Microcomputer last Monday,	July 
13.  I have just spent the past several days going over this 
unit, and thought you might find my first impressions inter-
esting.

     First  some technical information at random.  Note that 
this  is  an initial production unit.	There  may  be	many   
changes before units get in customer hands. Yes, all digital 
electronics are on one board!  (and quite a good looking one 
at  that!).  Only the boards for the drives and the  monitor 
electronics are seperate.    Memory appears to use 4116 type 
chips.	The CPU looks like the Japaneese NEC Z-80 Copy!  The 
drives	are  10 Soft Sector with Standard capacity of  102K.  
This  is supposed to be expandable through a double  density 
option.  The  ones in the unit we have are made by  Seimans.  
All  we have received in the way of software is a very	bare 
version of CP/M ( SYSGEN,  COPY,  PIP,	and FORMAT,  but  no 
Assembler or DDT ),  and Microsoft Basic-80.  Both appear to 
work  beautifully on the Osborne.   The caliber of the	CP/M 
utilities  sent is excellent (the FORMAT program  automatic-
ally checks the media for example!).  One interesting bit of 
information  is  that there is apparently a Real Time  clock 
function for DATE and TIME which will be set through a SETUP 
program.  The Microsoft manual, by the way, is a copy of the 
Standard  Basic 80 one,  but is fully typeset and thus	much 
more readable.

     OK.  Time for first impressions.	Taken in the context 
of an economical and complete way to get into computing (and 
CP/M  software in particular) it is a great machine.   It is 
true  that  you may not be able to expand  the	machine  for 
ever,  but how many of us have been able to afford to create 
our  "dream  machines".   Ever	try to talk YOUR  wife	into 
agreeing to let you spend $6,000 for a hard disk (but I just 
HAVE  to have it!).   The 52 character format of the  screen 
may might seen hard to get used to,  but it is a window on a 
larger	128 X 36 character screen.  By pressing the  Control 
key  and  one of the arrow keys,  you INSTANTLY  scroll  the 
screen.  I cannot praise the speed of the scroll enough.  It 
is  extremely  smooth  and  fast,  and	will  overcome	many 
objections  of	the screen format.  And if you	truly  can't  
stand  the  small  screen and don't like  the  9"  ($250.00) 
monitor,  then just connect a "Professional" terminal to the 
RS-232 port,  reassign the CON:  to the port and off you  go 
with a full 80 characters!

     I	am going to reserve final judgement until I see  the 
rest of the software.	But, from what I have seen so far, I 
feel that Mr.  Osborne has done just what he started out  to 
do  - Place a full function CP/M business system within  the 
reach of anyone and made it portable to boot!

     More information will follow shortly.   Please call  me 
if you want more info.

Subject: CPM eats control chars going to listing device?
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC, INFO-MICRO at MIT-MC


Recently I have become endowed with a CPM system of strange
origins. It has a version of CPM by some group called Teletek.
Since it has a nice EPSOM printer hanging off of it,
myself and a friend have become intersted in doing
intersting things with the printer(like boldface,widetype etc)
via assembly language hacking.

Apparently as far as we can tell CPM eats control characters
going to the 'list device'. Is this normal for CPM? If so
is there anyway to turn it off,so that one can just send
any character one wants to the printer. Does anyone know
where in memory the i/o routines usually lurk???

Thanks Muchly,
Have fun

Subject:  Multi-user, etc., revisited
To: INFO-MICRO at MIT-MC, INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

In the last few months it seems a number of multi-user systems have
come out of the woodwork and are demanding our attention.  My office
has been investigating several systems and are aware of several
others, mainly through advertising in the various trade magazines.

What we'd like to do is build up a better base of information on the
schemes available and of those, which ones actually exist, in use at a
customer's site - not a prototype.

I would like to hear first-, and possibly, second-hand information in
those two catagories: what is actually available, and of those,
end-user descriptions of the system features and failings.

The major criteria is that the system must provide an environment
capable of running any program designed to run under CP/M 1.4 or 2.2
with a shared hard disk and be capable of spooling output to at least
one shared printer.

We are already aware of and in the process of evaluating Micro-Mike's
JOESHARE, and Action Computer Enteprise's DPC/OS and MuSYS's MuDOS.
We are only aware of OSM's ZEUS system and Micromation's M/NET from
seeing them demonstrated at the West Coast Computer Faire.

Since then we have come across many others apparently capable of
handling the basic requirement (with the secondary advantage of being
able to share files as well - currently a limitation of the Micro-Mike
system).

Again, we would like to hear from end-users of any of these systems
with mail addressed directly to FJW@MC - and NOT to these lists.  I
will consolidate the replies and send out a pointer later.

Thanks,
Frank

Subject: More complete documentation on squeeze programs
To: INFO-CPM at MIT-MC

		      SQUSQFLS.DOC
	Documentation for FLS, SQ, USQ, and TYPESQ

---------------------------------------------------------------

FLS.COM

 The purpose of this program is to build parameter lists
 for programs such as the SQ and USQ file compression
 utilities. This and those programs use the directed io
 package to allow redirection of console input and/or output.
 They are coded to accept parameters from the console input or
 from the command line. Each parameter is on a seperate line.

 Names beginning with '-' are passed through as options.

 Drive names (with ':') alone are also passed through.

 Other parameters are treated as ambiguous file names with
 optional drive specification. The disk directory is searched
 and every specific file name which matches the pattern is
 sent to the output list (with the optional drive specifier).
 If there are no matches a comment is sent to the console.

 Example test run (output to console):
      A>fls.c c:*.com b:.h

 Example to build list in "file":
      A>fls.c c:*.com b:.h >file

 Example to build list in file and send to console too:
      A>fls.c c:*.com b:.h +file

 Example to build list and run program SQ.COM with list
 substituting for keyboard input:
      A>fls b:.c d:*.?Q? |sq

---------------------------------------------------------------

SQ.COM

 This program compresses a file without loosing information.
 The usq.com program is required to unsqueeze the file
 before it can be used.

 Typical compression rates are:
      .COM    6%      (Don't bother)
      .ASM    33%     (using full ASCII set)
      .DIC    46%     (using only uppercase and a few others)

 Squeezing a really big file takes a few minutes.

 Useage:

      SQ item ...

 where ... represents more (optional) items and "item" is
 either:

      drive:	      to change the output drive

      file	      input file

      drive:file      input file


 If no such items are given on the command line you will be
 prompted for commands (one at a time). An empty command
 terminates the program.

 SQ uses the dio package, so input and output can be redirected
 by special items on the command line such as:

      <file	      reads console input from file

      >file	      sends console output to file

      +file	      sends console output to console and file


 Also console output of another program using dio can be piped
 to the input of this one or vice-versa. Example:

      A>fls parameters |sq


 where fls might be a program that expands patterns like.com to
 a list of ambiguous file names for sq to squeeze.

 The squeezed file name is formed by changing the second letter
 of the file type to Q. If there is no file type, the squeezed
 file type is QQQ. If the name exists it is overwritten!

 Examples:

      A>SQ GRUMP	      makes GRUMP.QQQ on A:

      A>SQ D:CRAP.XYZ	      makes CRAP.XQZ on A:

      A>SQ B: D:CRAP.COM      makes CRAP.CQM on B:

      B>SQ X.A C: Y.B	      makes X.AQ on B: and Y.BQ on C:


 The transformations compress strings of identical bytes and
 then encode each resulting byte value and EOF as bit strings
 having lengths in inverse proportion to their frequency of
 occurrance in the intermediate input stream.  The latter uses
 the Huffman algorithm.	 Decoding information is included in
 the squeezed file, so squeezing short files or files with
 uniformly distributed byte values will actually increase size.

---------------------------------------------------------------

USQ.COM

 Program to unsqueeze files formed by sq.com.

 Useage:

      USQ item ...

 where ... represents more (optional) items and "item" is
 either:

      drive:	      to change the output drive

      file	      input file

      drive:file      input file


 If no such items are given on the command line you will be
 prompted for commands (one at a time). An empty command
 terminates the program.

 USQ uses the dio package, so input and output can be redirec-
 ted by special items on the command line such as:

      <file	      reads console input from file

      >file	      sends console output to file

      +file	      sends console output to console and file


 Also console output of another program usinf dio can be piped
 to the input of USQ or vice-versa. Example:

      A>fls parameters |usq

 where fls might be a program that expands patterns like.asm to
 a list of specific file names for usq to unsqueeze.

 The unsqueezed file name is recorded in the squeezed file.

 Examples:

      A>USQ GRUMP.QQQ	      writes on a:

      A>USQ D:CRAP.XQZ	      writes on A:

      A>USQ B: D:CRAP.CQM     writes on B:

      B>USQ X.AQ C: Y.BQ      writes X.?? on B: and Y.?? on C:

---------------------------------------------------------------

TYPESQ.COM

 Program to print squeeze files formed by sq.com.

	  TYPESQ.DOC as of 7/6/81
   by Bob Mathias and Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

TYPESQ.COM is a program primarily for use on remote
CP/M systems to allow typing "squeezed" files.  It
does not accept wild cards, but will accept multiple
file names on the command line, separated by spaces.
The output to the console is "filtered" (like MLIST)
to eliminate control characters other than CR, LF,
TAB, or FORMFEED.

The source code file TYPESQ.C is compiled the same
way as USQ.  See SQBUILD.DOC for instructions.

TYPESQ is based on USQ by Richard Greenlaw, and was
written by Bob Mathias, with suggestions from Keith
Petersen.

The .COM and .DOC files are available on MC as:
AR3:CPM;TYPESQ COM   and  AR3:CPM;TYPESQ DOC
The source code is there too: AR3:CPM;TYPESQ C

Sure is nice to be able to squeeze all the big ASM and DOC
files on my remote CP/M system!  I freed up 600k on the hard
disk.  The average reduction is 35-40 percent, depending upon
the makeup of the file.  The reduction may be even greater if
the file contains a lot of spaces.

The above patch MAY work, but it depends on what address your cpm 
runs at. Try instead the following:

     S125F
      125F 5F AF        (SAME AS ABOVE)
      1260 ?? .

     S12C0 CD 18        (PUT IN A RELATIVE JUMP)
      12C1 ?? 01
      12C2 ?? 00        (THIS DOESN'T MATTER)
      12C3 06 06        (DON'T CHANGE)
      12C4 06 01
      12C5 ?? .

     S12E1 
      12E1 CD 18	(ANOTHER RELATIVE JUMP)
      12E2 ?? 04
      12E3 ?? ??
      12E4 CD 18	(YET ANOTHER RELATIVE JUMP)
      12E5 ?? 01
      12E6 ?? .

When ZSID relocates itself an offset is added to bytes 12c2, 12e3, and
12e6. The previous patch left this offset to be interpreted as an opcode.
The result can be benign or disastrous depending on the size of your 
cpm.

   SQ/USQ/FLS file update notice - 6/27/81
	 by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

This is a list of CRCs for the latest SQ/USQ/FLS files,
obtained from Richard Greenlaw (the author) on 6/27/81.

The author recently updated some of the programs, which will
require replacement of many of the previously-released files,
including SQ.COM, USQ.COM and FLS.COM.

Most of the files in MC:CPM; have been moved to an "archive" device.
The simplified expanation of this mechanism is to consider the archive
devices as "subdirectories".  Normally, there is an implied device,
DSK:, asssociated with each file.  With a file in an archive device,
you must explicitly name the archive device, ARn:.  Other than that,
you can reference the files as you normally do.

These archive devices show up in the normal directory listing as:

MC:CPM;
  1   AR0    DOCFIL  32 +440  - All doc and misc files
  14  AR1    COMFIL  23 +604  - All COM files
  14  AR2    HLPFIL  26 +674  - All HLP files
  0   AR3    SQ/USQ  12 +222  - All sources to SQ/USQ/FLS
  1   AR4    APPLE   28 +875  - All APPLE/Z80 files (mostly MODEM)

Each of these, in turn have their own directory listings for the
individual files.  (Use :FIND AR1:CPM;  to list all of the COM files.)

For example, to reference the HELP COM file, use AR1:CPM;HELP COM .

If you have any problems with this, please send a note to

Subject: MOV E,0/MOV E,B
To:   info-cpm at MC

Hi, All,

        A question was raised recently as to why the  assembler  would
interpret MOV E,0 as MOV E,B, and I thought I'd transmit my answer for
general interest.  Response follows.

        Re  your  question as to why the assembler would interpret MOV
E,0 as MOV E,B, the assembler maintains an internal symbol  table  for
the  registers  in  which  B  is  equated  to 0, C to 1, etc.  The MOV
instruction appears in binary as:

                0 1 D D D S S S

where DDD are three bits representing  the  destination  and  SSS  are
three  bits  representing  the  source.  When the assembler puts these
instructions (MOV) together, a common technique  is  to  look  up  the
register   names   in   a   register  symbol  table  and  place  their
corresponding values into the proper fields within the binary  of  the
instruction.  For instance,

                MOV A,B -> 01 111 000 (A=7, B=0)

The instruction MOV 7,0 would generate the same effect (bit pattern).

        From my experience, all the 8080 assembler's I have used (ASM,
ASM2, MAC, and M80) use a technique similar to this.  Consequently, it
is possible to make a mistake like MOV A,0 when you wanted to load a 0
into A and the assembler would not catch it as a syntax error.

        Following are some further examples.

From: fylstra.tsca at SRI-Unix
Via:  tsca.MicomNet; 23 Jun 81 1:02-PDT

This may have been attempted before, but I thought it sufficiently
interesting to report to everyone...

This evening, Term Kovattana and I succeeded in using the MODEM2 program
for reliably transferring files between CP/M systems over an RS-232 link
at 9600 baud.  The two systems were an S-100 system (Cromemco Z2-D)
with 8 inch floppy disks and a HeathKit H89 with 5 inch floppy disks.
We used the latest version, [mc]cpm;modem206 asm, modified as appropriate
for the corresponding serial ports.  This program transmits binary
files in packets consisting of a header, sequence number, data, and
a checksum, and provides a simple ack/nak/timeout protocol.  We used
the "quiet" mode at each end of the connection to avoid problems caused
by program status messages garbaging the transmission.  It is a real
pleasure to see a 10K file zipping between systems in seconds!

Incidentally, the initial download from the Z2 to the H89 was accomplished
using standard CP/M tools as follows:

	Z2 end                          H89 end

pip crt:=ftp89.hex              pip ftp89.hx=rdr:[b]
pip crt:=con:
   ctl-S  ctl-Z                 ; file at this end is flushed
pip crt:=eof:                   ; file at this end is closed
				ren ftp89.hex=ftp89.hx

The [b] switch causes the receiving end to buffer the 10K hex file
in memory until the ctl-S is received as a result of the second command
line at the sending end.  Finally, the third command line transmits
a ctl-Z which causes the receiving end to close its file.  The '.hx'
file extension is used to prevent the receiving PIP from wasting time
verifying Intel Hex format while reading the file, and is subsequently
renamed to '.hex'.

Next step...attempt to transfer files between a TOPS-20 and a CP/M
system over a hard line at 9600 baud.

Re your patch, on the 6th line down (or so) from the "patch1" label,
shouldn't the instruction be "mvi e,0" rather than "mov e,0"?  The
"mov e,0" would be equivalent to "mov e,b" by the assembler, generate
no error, and work only if the B reg happened to contain 0.

bios was written in their own funny assembler, so they 'hand-recoded'
all the macros to be compatible with cp/m asm. needless to say, the bios
is really junky and not easy to read.  Rather than key in all 15 pages of
it, I sprang for $45 and mailed my EXISTING CP/M disc back to Godbout
They claim they will integrate their bios into my new cp/m, give me movcpm, etc.
and save me from ordering another cp/m at $150.
(What they really do, is lift my serial number, brun a new cp/m, and
trash the disc i sent in.)
Let me add that a long time ago i had problems running
the CROMEMCO ZPU at 4 meg.  My solution was to rip out the imsai motherboard
and install a Thinker Toys 'Wunderbuss' 20 slot terminated motherboard.
If you are using the imsai mother, yu may have problems with the godbout or any
other board at 4 meg.
The software with cp/m should arrive this week, will let you know what happens.

Does anyone know of a list, in the public domain, of CP/M functions (Heath/
Zenith version preferably) and the CPU registers that each function
destroys (i.e. which registers I must save with my program before calling
the BDOS.)  I would rather read a chart than do each one out on my own.

Subject: poll
To: info-cpm at ai

It has been proposed that a new list be started to continue the
(now practically invisible) discussion about CP/M vs. UNIX.
I consider this to be a rather useless exercise, since the discussion
has been dying out under its own weight in any case.  I also feel
that further fragmentation of lists is to be avoided whenever possible.

Whenever there is a flash flood of messages on a given topic, there
seems to be an immediate call from a vocal minority to START A NEW LIST.
Of course, the topic usually dies out pretty quickly, and we are left
with a practically dead list.  Time goes by, and someone has a message
to send on that topic, but hardly anyone even REMEMBERS the new list,
so it ends up going to the old, original pre-splinter list.  This is
a good thing actually, since by that time new people have joined the
original list who have not even HEARD of the new list, since it has
been essentially inactive.

I don't have a TRS-80, or an APPLE, but somehow I have managed to live
with flurries of messages to INFO-MICRO on this topic.  Better to have
the message available -- it can always be deleted.

But maybe I'm wrong.  I propose a poll.  For the purposes of this
poll, I am presuming that the UNIX vs. CP/M messages continue
to occur at a low level and taper off to none within a week or so.

The question is:

DO YOU WISH TO SEE A NEW LIST STARTED SPECIFICALLY TO DISCUSS 
THE TOPIC OF UNIX VS. CP/M, AND HAVE ALL MESSAGES ON THIS TOPIC
DIVERTED FROM ANY OTHER LISTS?

If you feel a new list is called for, vote YES.
If you feel the present situation will be adequate, vote NO.

Please send me your vote.  It should have a subject line
of POLL followed by the single word YES or NO.
If you cannot generate a subject line, please use the first
line of your message for your vote.

I will consider the vote to be ended Tuesday evening at 11:59 PM.

I hope there is no unilateral action taken on this subject before
the vote is concluded.

Subject: UNIX vs. CPM


There are a couple of screen oriented editors available under UNIX,
namely vi (visual editor) which comes with 4bsd, and ned,
from RAND.  Two other comments:  As regards UNIX being new and
unproven vs. CPM being established and proven I think you will
find that the reverse is true, UNIX has been around for a long time.
The only thing unproven about it is the new versions being written
for micros.  But 90+% of the code is independent of this, especially
the utilities.  A big point was also made of the tools available under
CPM.  The author has obviously not been on a UNIX system for a long
time.  As far as I know there is nothing available under CPM comparable
to make, awk, sed, diction, grep, (v)troff, yacc, and lex, which either
alone (or especially when combined using pipes) I find VERY useful
both for system work AND on a day to day basis.  Several months ago we
received a cataloging system we were to use in keeping track of papers
being reviewed for publication in the proceedings of a conference.
It was written in FORTRAN, and the listing was more than an inch thick.
A trial compilation produced 2 to 5 errors per page of code both
from the UNIX FORTRAN compiler and the IBM H FORTRAN compiler.
Rather than convert it, I and one other person rewrote it into
a better and more flexible system using make, awk, sed, sort, nroff,
tbl and col.  This took about 7 hours (total) from me and 2 for him,
and contained not a single line of code in any conventional high
level language, just two or three pages of scripts for the various
utilities (mostly make).  At the time I had 3 months experience
on UNIX and had never used any of the mentioned tools except nroff.
None of this would have been possible on CPM, and in fact the main
thing going for CPM is that it was the only fairly standardized
operating system available for micros, UNTIL NOW.

Subject: Response to Berkeley (3) -- Byron Howes
To:   decvax!duke!unc!bch at BERKELEY
cc:   info-cpm at MC

Greetings,

        In reply to Byron Howes message of 18  June,  from  a  systems
programming   point   of   view,  I  concur  almost  completely.   The
multiprogramming attributes of UNIX  give  it  many  capabilities  and
features   not   found  in  CP/M.   And  UNIX  is  definitely  a  more
sophisticated OS!  I have already outlined such feelings before.

        My  thrust,  however,  is  in  the  direction  of  a  multiple
processor CP/M environment (re bottom of the next to the last  par  on
Page  8 of my 27,700+ message of 15 June).  In this environment, I see
no "user-level" function that he can do which I can't if I wanted  to.
For  instance,  to be notified of incoming mail while I am doing other
things can be done by letting one  of  the  slaves  "ring"  me  on  an
alternate  terminal  or  display  while  I am working with the master.
When the message comes in, I leave the master's keyboard and go to the
slave's.   As  for  after-hours transmission and scheduled processing,
MP/M already supports  SCHED  which  permits  this,  and  my  multiple
processor  environment could do this also (with one slave dedicated to
batch jobs and scheduled processing of other kinds).

        As  for  transportability  of software, I still feel that CP/M
has an advantage over UNIX.  Look at it this way:  if I  were  a  UNIX
user  and  wanted  to  run  Word  Star  under  UNIX,  I  would have to
disassemble Word Star and its overlays into  assembly  language  (Word
Star  is available conventionally only in binary!), decode the meaning
of the program (decidedly non-trivial), and translate into C  or  some
other   form   transportable   to   my   UNIX   environment.    CP/M's
transportability is on the binary level!

        On  the other hand, if I were a CP/M user and wanted to run wc
under CP/M, I would get the source to wc in C and compile it using one
of  the  C  compilers that run under CP/M.  Yes, I may have to do some
translation of the source for inter-compiler compatability and I  will
have  to  have  a library of functions used by wc that are implemented
under CP/M (like putc, getc, etc.).

        Under CP/M (once my C library is built), I need only translate
C source code and compile and link in order to use the world of  UNIX-
compatable  software;  under UNIX, I need to reconstruct programs from
their binary forms, and for programs like Word  Star  (over  80  K  of
binary  on  disk,  incl  overlays), the problem of transportability to
UNIX is definitely non-trivial.

        Mince  (similar  to EMACS) is an editor written in BDS C which
stands as an example.  I suspect that Mince was only  patterned  after
EMACS  (not  copied),  but  isn't  copying  of  the public-domain UNIX
software possible?

Hi 

        Thanks for the data re UNIX editors and mail systems.  Can you
provide references?

        As for your comment  about  standardization  of  CP/M,  in  my
27,000+  char  msg  of 15 June, I claimed that the command interpreter
(re page 2) was NOT part of the kernal [command interpreter = shell of
UNIX and CCP of CP/M].  My CP/M system differs from others in the CCP,
NOT the BDOS (which is where CP/M transportability is  enabled).   The
world  of  marketed software for CP/M is still open to me, and only my
user (console) interface is different.

cc:   duke!decvax!ucbvax at BERKELEY, info-cpm at MC

Hi, All,

        Discussion  seems  to have been renewed!  Marvelous!  It looks
like some real UNIX hackers (system programmer types) have gotten into
the act!  Welcome!

        In response to the first irate UNIX hacker (name unknown) [msg
dted  16  Jun at 20:58:12-PTD from duke!decvax!unc!smb at Berkeley], I
wonder what he read!?!  First of all, I assume he is referring to  the
message  of  15  Jun  at 12:31 EDT from AFITGORDON since it is 27,700+
chars and he made reference to a 25K file.

        The  following  answers his accusations in order (the order in
his message):

        1.  He claims that I said that "CP/M has more proven tools
            than  UNIX".   What  I  said  was  "I  have  not  seen
            comparable  field-proven  software  on  the  NEW  UNIX
            systems" (pg 7), which is not saying the  same  thing;
            to  be exact, I was hoping it would invite information
            which would increase my own knowledge on  the  subject
            of UNIX tools.

        2.  I did NOT say that UNIX has "No screen editor"; what I
            said  was  "Are  there any screen oriented editors and
            formatters?"  (pg 3).

        3.  I  did NOT say that UNIX had "No ability for ...  user
            to have a tailored  command  set";  what  I  said  was
            "special work environments, each with their own set of
            commands, can be easily created" (pg 4, par  1.)   and
            "specialized   shells   or  even  menu-driven  command
            environments can be created with ease" (pg 4, par 2.).

        4.  I   did   NOT   say   that   UNIX   does  NOT  support
            transportability; what I said was "Both UNIX ....   an
            CP/M  are  generally adequate, extensible, and support
            transportable  software"  (pg  7,   2nd   full   par).
            Further,  I  am aware of Bell's portability ideas from
            "Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System", BSTJ,
            Jul-Aug  78,  Vol  57, No 6, Part 2, ISSN0005-8580, by
            Johnson and Ritchie.

        5.  Finally,  your impression is correct concerning my use
            of UNIX.  I have touched it just a few times,  and  do
            NOT have extensive experience with it.  We are running
            UNIX on our PDP 11/60 at AFIT, and I  am  involved  on
            its  committee and have touched it only once.  My data
            in these messages (as I  have  already  stated)  comes
            from  the  Bell  System  Technical Journal I have been
            quoting and our own UNIX manuals.

        Appearantly,  this message has stemmed from the sender reading
all sorts of things into my message.  He has been trying to put  words
into my mouth while we are saying the same thing all along!

        The purpose of my messages  has  been  to  pass  data,  and  I
encourage  your  responses  concerning data (with references) on UNIX.
But let's not launch any personal, critical attacks  based  upon  what
you are reading into what I am saying as opposed to what I am actually
saying.  Your message only provided a minimum of new info  on  V7  PWB
and 32V (UNIX-32 for VAX?), and the rest of it repeated what I already
said (agreeing with me, by the way).  If you do not feel that you have
agreed  with me, cite the page and paragraph in which I said something
contrary to your views.

        If  you  or  anyone else wishes to review the entire dialog, I
have been maintaining a reading file of what I considered  to  be  the
critical messages (both sides) and will be happy to transmit it to you
(preferably FTP it).

There are a number of us on the usenet who have been following the
cp/m- **nix discussion curiously and with some horror.  Unfortunately,
because of the nature of the gateway between the usenet and the
arpanet, we cannot participate directly in this novel dialog unless
some kind soul is willing to rebroadcast messages we mail to
INFO-CPM@MIT-MC.  We feel we can add significantly to this discussion
since at least one of our number (unc!smb) has installed **nix on an
IBM system.

Frankly, I have always considered cp/m to be something less than an
operating system in that it has absolutely no process/task management
beyond the timed multiple user support offered by MP/M.  Resource
management, beyond this, is restricted to disk space conservation.  Any
significant operating system functions such as parallel processes and
process control involve actually zapping the os on the fly as in
DESPOOL.

**NIX, on the other hand, provides a full complement of process
scheduling mechanisms which allow users great flexibility in their use
of the system.  For example,  I am currently editing a message to be
sent on (through several other unix systems) to whomever is out there
to read it.  At the same time, I am waiting for mail from whomever
chooses to send to me (an alarm will sound on my terminal if it comes
in \while/ I am entering this.  Should I choose, I can push the editing
session into the background, respond to the message, and recall this
editing session all with process management commands.  When I complete
the message I will drop it off to the system to be sent on at an
appropriate time, more than likely in the middle of the night when I am
not signed on.  Further, I can submit processes to be executed hours,
days, or weeks from now without intervention on my own part.  The basis
for all of this is built in to the **nix operating system.  I do not
believe these capabilities exist in cp/m.

As afitgordon pointed out, any software written for one os can be (in
some sense) transported to another (this may involve a complete
rewrite, but...)  Thus, it is not valid to compare operating systems on
the basis of the software written to run under them.  It \is/ valid to
compare operating systems on the basis of what the functions of an

I'm fascinated -- 25K bytes to conclude that CP/M has more proven tools
than UNIX???  The two greatest virtues of UNIX are its wide range of
tools, and the methods the operating system provides to combine them.
No screen editor?  I thought vi came out several years ago.  No ability
for an individual user to have a tailored command set?  Version 7 PWB,
and 32V UNIX systems allow a settable search path for commands (no, it
does not search "up the tree"), and even on V6 systems it's easy to
have a single private command library.  Transportability? UNIX runs on
many different machines made by many different vendors; CP/M is
restricted to the 8080 and Z-80.  I could go on, but I prefer to keep
this short.  However, I have the distinct impression that AFITGORDON
has little or no experience with UNIX or with the UNIX user community.

I'm fascinated -- 25K bytes to conclude that CP/M has more proven tools
than UNIX???  The two greatest virtues of UNIX are its wide range of
tools, and the methods the operating system provides to combine them.
No screen editor?  I thought vi came out several years ago.  No ability
for an individual user to have a tailored command set?  Version 7 PWB,
and 32V UNIX systems allow a settable search path for commands (no, it
does not search "up the tree"), and even on V6 systems it's easy to
have a single private command library.  Transportability? UNIX runs on
many different machines made by many different vendors; CP/M is
restricted to the 8080 and Z-80.  I could go on, but I prefer to keep
this short.  However, I have the distinct impression that AFITGORDON
has little or no experience with UNIX or with the UNIX user community.

Hi, All,

        I concur with the idea about creating a new list, but I,  too,
feel  that  the commentaries have run their course.  I am preparing my
"final" set of comments now, and will be ready to move  on  to  others
very  shortly.   For  instance, with the emphasis on CP/M and UNIX, NO
ONE (except me, now) has mentioned Ada and the  work  being  done  (no
where  near  release) by over 70 major firms (including IBM, Goodyear,
Ford Aerospace, and I forget who else) on the Ada Language  Integrated
Computer  Environment  (ALICE)  and  the  potential  extension  of its
concepts into other areas (including Office Automation)!

        By  the  way,  please  include  me on the new list, but NOT as
AFITGORDON; use CONN@MC.

Hi Budley - I pretty much agree with all your points, except for the
need to do something.  Even though I am not the person who put this
issue into INFO-CPM, or the person who requested that the long CC list
be included on all mail, I have gotten lots of flack from a small number
of people who are incredibly upset about the long CC fields in those
messages.  There is no way to resolve the "long CC" problem without
forming a new list, whether it lasts very long or not.

We have been operating across interest group boundaries with a formal
group included among a mixed informal list of others who could not be
added to the info-CPM list because they are not interested in INFO-CPM
in general.

So far I have about 10 names for the new list, and they are still coming
in.  When we get to 20 or so, I think we should cut over to the new
list.

Then, if the discussion converges to closure, we should all celebrate
the end of the discussion by shutting down the list.  Discussion group
lists are easily created, and they should just as easily end.

Cheers - Stef

I do not agree with your conclusion about needing a new mailing list.  If a
new list is established, then please include me (BHuber@USC-ECL).  It is my
opinion that the UNIX versus CP/M topic will not be "resolved" by message
traffic on this net, but that the quantity of related traffic has essentially
reached its zenith and we will move on to other topics.  This topic appears
to be close to running its course.

Re:   MODEM working!!

	
I managed to get the thing working, using the CPM system calls from PLINK,
as I mentioned earlier.  The problem with the bad sectors was that my 
subroutine to read a character stripped the parity bit, thus providing
a guarenteed wrong header/checksum.  
	
It is a bit of a kluge, but it works.  I used conditionals around all
of the system calls to any MODCTLP, MODDATP, or MOD---- sympols, using
IF TRS  and IF NOT TRS, so that it may still be assembled for other things.

As soon as I get a chance to xfer it over to the PDP-10, I'll let you or

There is a company up in the Boston area (Computer Service Systems

OS that supposedly will allow programs to run 10 to 14 times faster.
The yet unnamed system's description goes on with wording reminicent
of the SPEED writeup and is initially offered for their own Z80-based
general-purpose business computers.  Anybody know better details on
this one?  (Electronics, June 2, 1981, pg. 34)

Out of today's mail:  Electronics, June 16, 1981:

Under the heading (pg. 33) "Xerox to market personal computer..."
with the announcement of the 820 which most of you may have seen
already, is "... with IBM to follow suit" Called Chess, it is an
8088-based system priced between $3-4K, and includes two DSDD 5-1/4
Tandon floppy drives, a detachable keyboard.  An OS "similar to CP/M"
from Microsoft (IBM Personal Computer DOS), from 64K to 256K RAM, and
a "600-by-400-line" B&W display and able to handle eight colors with a
resolution of 400x200 pixels or four colors at 800x400.  Look for it
to be announced next month and check out Sears, Computerland, and
maybe J.C. Penney.

Hi Dave - I feel that this discussion has either reached the point of
becoming an alternating multilogue, or it is about to converge on a
useful focus for discussion of important issues.  Maybe it is time to
establish yet another special focus discussion group mailing facility.
Or it is time to end the discussion.  It certainly seems to be time to
separate this from the entire INFO-CPM list.

May I suggest that you set up a "mail-drop" for this UNIX-CPM discussion
group on UDEL?  I will help establish the initial list, and help
maintain it in any way I can.

The first step as I see it will be to collect requests from recipients
of this message to be included in the group mailing list.  This will
tell us whether there is enough real interest to continue.

I have cleaned out the erroneous addresses that have accumulated into
the CC field by propigation, and have stashed the list in
[KA]<STEF>ADDR.UNIX-CPM:* for who ever might want to grab a copy for
their own use.

I am not sure how many of the recipients really want to receive all this
mail.  Only Jerry Pournelle has complained so far, and I have left him
off the list per his request.

The list for now is as follows:

"[KA]<STEF>ADDR.UNIX-CPM;1":  INFO-CPM@MIT-MC, AFITGORDON@BBNB,
WANCHO@DARCOM-KA, Stef@DARCOM-KA, IME-TECOM@OF2, Labhart@OF2,
Hewitt@OF2, SAD@SRI-KL, EBoyd@OF2, Christina@OF2, TECOM-HQ@OF2,
TBowerman@DARCOM-KA, TECOM-C3I@OF2, Farber@UDEL,

I will start the new list from scratch.  Anyone wanting to be included,
please reply to this message from the mailbox you want the UNIX-CPM mail

Let me answer your message in pieces. First of all Unix runs on
a larger class of systems than just the 11. It runs on a Ahlmahl,
on the Z8000, on the Univ 1110, on the 68000, on the Tandum,
on the Prime and will soon run on the 8086 and the IAPX286 as well
as probably on the new HP 32 bit system. Thats a fair number.

As to CP/M being an old system, I am speaking to the architecture
of the system NOT to its age. While Unix is not up to current "best"
ideas in system organization, it is much better than CP/Ms. (If you
want a better orgnaization try RMX86). 

More latter.

There are actually several 'Unix-like' systems for micros...
Some with good, some with bad reputations.  I haven't used any
of them myself, but consensus seems to be that OMNIX and OS1 are
losers, and Cromix and MARC are winners.  All of these are
Z80 or 8080/Z80 based.  For 68xx fans, there is Uniflex.

Cromix is offered by Cromemco, and I assume therefore that
it is intended only to run on Cromemco machines.  Their earlier
operating system, CDOS, was more-or-less compatible with CPM 1.4,
but I don't know if there is any hope of running CPM2.2 stuff.
For more info: Cromemco, 280 Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94040.
  415 964-7400

MARC has some very interesting possibilities... it boots up under any
CPM system, it does have a CPM emulator (probably 1.4), and has
hard disk support.  It runs on 8080/Z80s.  For more info,
contact: Vortex Technology, POB 2284, Culver City, CA 90230
  213 645-7200

Uniflex, for 68xx machines (I'm not sure which are supported), is a
product of Technical Systems Consultants.  I don't have their
address handy.

Not hearing any screams of pain, requests for removal from the list, or
requests to cease and desist, I will assume everyone else is enjoying
this more or less.

I want to note that I am more interested in the prospects for the future
attractiveness of UNIX vs CP/M (MP/M & CPNet too) than with the history
of either of them.  This is not to say that I do not enjoy knowing the
history.  My point is that my evaluation is based on future potentials
rather than historical facts.

Also, my evaluation is based on an institutional perspective for finding
the best way for an institution to provide personal computing for the
mass of individual employees, rather than in finding ways for individual
employees to do their own thing, whether it be system hacking or not.

I have no disagreement with those who, as individuals, wish to choose
CP/M for themselves.  Indeed, if you are in a position to afford the
luxury of a non-institutional solution, more power to you.  In my own
case, I have this freedom, and I choose CP/M for now because of costs
and availablility.  But I plan to migrate to UNIX/XENIX in about one
year, and I will retain the right to change my mind when I see the real
alternatives when that time comes.

In the meantime, I must advise my clients to plan for the UNIX/XENIX
environment because of its greater potential for meeting institutional
needs, as described in my earlier statement of institutional
requirements.

I hope this clarifies our apparent disagreement.  It seems quite clear
that both UNIX and CP/M will be around for a very long time because both
will provide good value to significant segments of the market.

DAG@MIT-AI 06/17/81 02:35:43 Re: CP/M and UNIX
To: info-cpm at MIT-MC

In reading your commentary, it strikes me that there is one consideration
that is conspicously missing, that of upgradeability.  Although I have
found UNIX to be a whole lot of fun to use (as a systems type), it
is not practicle for some folks to consider.  To reitterate
some of the other comparisions of UNIX and CP/M-80 (note the suffix),
CP/M was designed for a single user small computer on 8080 level,
with at most 64k of memory.  UNIX was designed for an eleven.  It
is very difficult to consider the reletive merits of the two on 
the smaller machines, as (for the moment, and discounting rumors about
the Decision-1) UNIX is not available for the small CP/M machines.
For the larger machines, UNIX is great (but does not have loads of 
business type software).  I should think that for people on small
budgets, who already own an 8000 dollar CP/M type machine,
it would be near to immpossible to upgrade to UNIX on 16 bit
without a major expense.

What I would REALLY (underline that) would like to see would be
a form of UNIX (real live UNIX, not some thing claiming to have a
tree structure) that would run on the Z80 machine and would also
allow CP/M programs to run as well (say in a subdirectory).  If 
this could be done with a minimum of hardware (maybe a $500 board
to do some form of management) and a reasonable priced software 
package, it would be really neat and highly useful.  There
are rumors (I have a not quite working version) of a UNIX
like OS being developed by Ed Ziemba (who had a fatal diving 
accident recently, and whom many will miss) and Leor Zolman,
that is based on BDS C.  Also, the ONYX system is very nice,
provideing multi user UNIX on a Z8000 and hard disk for arround
18000 dollars end user.

So much for putting my two cents in.

Hello, Everyone,

        Before I get started, I want to say that I think this exchange
is  FANTASTIC!   I'm  learning  much  from it (and doing much research
because of it), and such a wide diversity of  views  is  enlightening,
entertaining, and enjoyable.

        I hope the following comments are useful, and I hope  I'm  not
deviating  too  much  from  the  original question.  As I view it, the
original question concerned  the  creation  of  a  microcomputer-based
office automation system and which OS should host it.

                                        Richard Conn

-------- Comments Follow --------

                                Part 1

        First,  I wish to take issue to the extreme with Dave Farber's
comments; I disagree with them almost  completely  (sorry,  Dave,  and
please  don't  take  offense, but I feel the following data speaks for
itself)!

        I  refer  to Dave's message (Farber@Udel-EE, sent 16 Jun 81 at
8:58 EDT).

        In  his first paragraph, Dave states that CP/M was created for
processors  with  small  memory  (8080's,  <=64K),  single   processor
configurations,  and  that "Systems based on such ...  assumptions ...
have had severe difficulties adapting as ...  [memory size  grew]  ...
and  ...  [multiprocessor configurations were created]."  I agree with
his statement about CP/M, but I disagree with the  material  I  quoted
and view it an an unsubstantiated value judgement.

        Dave goes on to imply that CP/M is "old fashioned" and  should
be discredited because of its age.  From my point of view (and this is
how I believe he intended us to believe), Dave is saying that UNIX  is
newer  than CP/M and was intended from the beginning to run on "larger
mainframes".  This is not true!

        When I first began work on my Master's at U of Illinois in 76,
I heard about UNIX long  before  I  heard  about  CP/M.   This  memory
prompted  me to do a little research, and the following summarizes the
results of this evenings research --

	
	UNIX				CP/M

o  1st Version:  1969		o  1st Version (1.0?):  1974

o  1st machine implemented on:
	PDP 7 & PDP 9			Intel Intellec? (8080)

o  2nd Version:  1971		o  2nd Version (2.0):  1979

o  2nd machines implemented on:
	PDP 11/20			Many 8080's, Z80's
	  1st released 1970
	  1 processor
	  32K words max memory
	  16-bit words

o  Upward-compatable OS Family:
	Compatability lies is in	Excellent upward-compatability
	C source code; OS "hooks"	on the binary (OS "hooks") level;
	at binary level show no		ASM assembler and PL/M source
	inter-version compatability	compatability maintained
	at all! (this is inferred,
	does anyone dispute with data?)	
   Compatability Synopsis:
	-None-				CP/M 1.3 -> CP/M 1.4 ->
					CP/M 2.0 -> CP/M 2.1 ->
					CP/M 2.2 -> MP/M 1.0 ->
					MP/M 1.1 -> CP/NET (MP/M-based)
					[CP/M 3.0 and CP/M-86 - no data]

o  Number of systems running OS:
	"over 600 installations"	over 200,000 installations
	(1978) on HW costing		(1979) on HW costing
	"as little as $40,000"		as little as $3,000 (my experience)

	

        The  above  information  came from the following sources:  (A)
UNIX info from (A1) "The UNIX Time-Sharing System" (Apr 78), The  Bell
System  Technical Journal, JUL-AUG 78, Vol 57, No 6, Part 2, ISSN0005-
8580 and [for PDP 11/20 info]  (A2)  "PDP  11/20,  15,  R20  Processor
Handbook",  Digital  Equipment  Corporation,  1971; (B) CP/M info from
"CP/M:  A Family of 8- and 16-Bit Operating Systems", Byte  Mag,  June
81, Pg 216, by Gary Kildall [creator of CP/M].

        From the above, the following information is not  documentably
substantiated:   (1)  binary-level  inter-version  UNIX  compatability
[these statements were made based on personal conversations], (2)  the
200,000  installation figure for CP/M [this statement made based on an
ad from Digital Research that I couldn't find  this  evening;  I  have
heard  later rumors as high as 400,000+!, but these are almost totally
undocumented], and  (3)  the  CP/M  $3,000  cost  [based  on  personal
experience with 5 1/4" floppies and 32K bytes memory].

        The compatability I mentioned above should be stressed on  the
binary level!  To my knowledge (based on conversation), the historical
versions of UNIX do not support the  same  hooks  (binary  level),  so
binary  written on one version cannot be transferred to another!  With
CP/M, however, I have written programs in assembly language which have
run  without modification (!!!)  on CP/M 1.3, CP/M 1.4, CP/M 2.0, CP/M
2.2, MP/M, 1.0, and MP/M 1.1!!!!  And  the  machines  that  this  CP/M
program  ran  on were Intel Multibus, IEEE S-100 (Z80), Cromemco S-100
(Z80), Ithaca Intersystems IEEE S-100 (Z80),  and  Electronic  Control
Technology IEEE S-100 (California Computer Systems Z80).  UNIX, on the
other hand, runs only on PDP 7, PDP 9, PDP 11, and  VAX  11  (All  DEC
UNIBUS except for the VAX with is DEC MASSBUS and UNIBUS).

        Another  complaint  was  the  lack  of  multiprogramming   and
multiprocessing  capabilities  with  CP/M.  To dispell these comments,
MP/M 1.1 can support up to 16 users, each having 64K (48K  work  area)
of  memory  and  running  on  a  single processor system.  CP/NET is a
network support system which runs under MP/M (required for  host)  and
CP/M  or  MP/M  (remotes)  which  allows  sharing  of  common data and
programs on each of the satellites (separate processors with their own
terminals,  printers,  and  disks)  with  the  host (also with its own
terminals, printers, and disks).  AND THIS IS  ALL  UPWARD  COMPATABLE
WITH  CP/M  2.2,  WHICH MEANS THAT PROGRAMS WRITTEN ON CP/M 2.2 CAN BE
MADE (SOMETIMES WITH NO MODIFICATION AT ALL!)   TO  RUN  ON  MP/M  AND
CP/NET!!!

        Now that I have issued all of these pro-CP/M arguments, I wish
to conclude by saying that --

                1.  Just because software has  been  around  for
                    some   time  does  not  mean  its  value  is
                    degraded with time; software is good or  bad
                    in  the eyes of the user only, regardless of
                    how long ago it was written

                2.  Although  I sound pro-CP/M, I do not view it
                    as a panacea!  My experience with  UNIX  has
                    been  pleasurable,  and  I  feel it has many
                    concepts which are interesting and of  value
                    (re my first message).

                3.  The OS, again, is just the RESOURCE  MANAGER
                    of  the computer system, and I feel that the
                    real value of the system lies in  the  tools
                    (editors, languages, DBMS's, debuggers, etc)
                    that run under the OS.   Transporability  of
                    software  under  CP/M  is  on the binary AND
                    source level, while  transportability  under
                    UNIX  is  ONLY  on the source level (Is this
                    correct?),  usually  in  C.   If  the   user
                    selects  UNIX, he could very well be burning
                    his bridges to the excellent  CP/M  programs
                    marketed  in  binary  (like MDBS, Word Star)
                    while he who selects CP/M  is  open  to  the
                    CP/M  programs  marketed in binary AND still
                    has the UNIX world open  since  C  compilers
                    run   under   CP/M  and  UNIX  transportable
                    programs are written in C (true?).   If  you
                    could  find a UNIX-like OS with can also run
                    CP/M binaries (OS-1 claims to  do  this),  I
                    feel   that   this  would  be  the  ultimate
                    solution to our discussions.

I am in (somewhat desperate) need of a Z8000 assembler which runs under
CP/M and produces either a HEX file or a REL file (HEX file more than
adequate, could even use an absolute BIN file).  Any suggestions, pointers,
etc. would be very helpful.  All replies to DAN@ML.

Whoa Steff-----------

I'm NOT talking about the TECOM cluster machine at all -- My entire
office is 4 engineers plus 3 support persons.  The entire budget for ADP
is in the range of $10K.  Harry's office (TECOM-C3I) is about 7
engineers, 4 support.  We want to be able to be independant of the large
mainframes if we want, but still retain full connect capability.

AFITGORDON's answer has come closest to what we wanted in regards to
comments.

If you know of it, TECOM's DMIS standalone Northstar-based system looks
nearly what we want (I've got some specific objections to that machine
but I really don't know enough about it to see if they can be gotten
around.)

Yes, the answers are going in two different directions, but your view is
not necessary the place I and Harry want to go for our individual office
machines.

I am NOT talking as part of TECOM's DMIS, and in fact have be taken to
task for sending out the requirement list in the first place.  They are
the ones that have all the $$$ and are going for the large main-frame.
I believe there is a place for both macro- and mini's in TECOM and right
now I'm concerned only with "MY" machine.

Although I suspect I'm be doing hacker like stuff on it (per my nature)
the primary use of the IME (International Materiel Evaluation - now
everyone knows where my address line came from!)  machine will be in
production work - messages to other TECOM offices, writting letters,
DF's, briefings, etc.  Primary users will be secretaries, clerks,
support persons who I suspect I'll have to teach after I learn it
myself.  (Sorry, but my wife won't let me but my own home computer until
I get "a couple" more promotions.)

I hope this clears up any misconceptions that I might of coused with the
first message.

Hi All ---

I think we are talking in two different contexts, and maybe even more.
So, here is an effort to refine our understanding of the context of the
original question so we can sort the answers given so far, and those
that are in the pipe for later.

As I see it, the context of the TECOM "Draft Requirements" was that of a
major institution with 5-10 "Computer Centers" serving several thousands
of users in several thousand offices spread across the continental US,
if not beyond.

The annual budget for each of the 5-10 centers might range from 0.5 to 3
million dollars per year, and the overall software development budget
for the next five years might range between 1 and 10 million dollars per
year for "capital" investment in applications software.

This is not an accurate description of TECOM per se, but it identifies a
class of organizations like TECOM.  For those who do not recognize the
acronym, TECOM is the US Army Test and Evaluation COMmand which is a
subordinate command within DARCOM.  TECOM sub-elements include White
Sands Missile Range, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Yuma Proving Ground, and
others, both large and small.  It is important to perceive the scale of
the target institution and its user population.

Now then, comes the question:  What operating systems environment should
be selected to "house" the applications to be developed?  What
"operating systems environment" might provide the richest vein of
software from "outside" sources.  In short, what is the preferred
"domain of software accumulation" for office automation (or workplace
automation, to be a bit more accurate) on which to focus the spending of
millions of dollars each year for applications software to be installed
and maintained in a network environment through some kind of central
software management arrangement?

In this context, the issues do not turn on a feature comparison as much
as they turn on assessment of the attractiveness of the alternative
environments to the total collection of software development
entrepreneurs, both in and out of captive institutions.

In short, view the alternative operating systems environments as
"marketplaces" and ask yourself which one you would risk your investment
dollars in with a new applications software product.  Among the things
you must consider are the size of your market exposure for sales.  Is
the CP/M system the richest market, or is the UNIX environment richer?

As a test of my idea here, I suggest the that CP/M community put
together a paper to show how CP/M provides an environment to compare
with the one described in BYTE magazine:  June 1981; "The UNIX Operating
System and the XENIX Standard Operating Environment."

My conclusion at this point in time is that UNIX provides the better
domain of accumulation for the next five years, and that is where I
would focus my development funds if I were a TECOM.

Please note that I am not a TECOM.  My firm is a one man company with
"offices" at home.  I work like many of you in the net, using the net as
my "electronic automated office."  Like Dave Farber, I want to get my
hands on the larger set of tools being built for the UNIX environment,
and I can hardly wait till a year from now when the economics will let
me get a personal UNIX based system for my private office; one that will
work comfortably in the network marketplace that is surely coming down
the pike.

It is very important to remember is that CP/M is a system created
for  processors  with  small  memory (8080s < 64k) and for single
processor  configerations.   Systems  based  on   such   starting
assumptions, in general, have had severe difficulties adapting as
the memory size available  grew  and  the  systems  aimed  toward
inherently multiprocessor systems.

CP/M is an 'old fashion system'. Unix, while full of problems, is
a  system  that  is  much more in the spirit of forthcoming micro
based software systems. Note also that because  Unix  is  in  the
main  a system for larger mainframes, the micros that use it will
inherit the software that is being  produced  on  and  for  these
large  system  -- not those produced for limited size old fashion
micros.  I for one (and I am sure this will create screams) would
be  happy  to  use  MVS or VMS on a microsystem I had (if it were
available) because of the hugh variety of software that has  been
produced and will be produced for these systems.

So CP/M is fine for what it is. It will live (at least as long as
systems  it  is useful for live). But as a long term system it is
no more viable that was FMS on the 7090.

You forgot to mention the obvious.
High on my list of the top ten dumbest
things about CP/M is the fact that it
doesn't maintain file modification times.
UNIX, of course, does.
