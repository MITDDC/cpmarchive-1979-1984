   SQ/USQ/FLS/TYPESQ file update notice - 7/22/81
	 by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ

This is a list of CRCs for the latest SQ/USQ/FLS files,
obtained from Richard Greenlaw (the author) on 7/22/81.
Also included are the new versions of TYPESQ from Bob
Mathias (the author) on 7/22/81.

Some of the programs have been updated. This will require
replacement of some of the previously-released files,
including USQ.COM, USQ.C, CHANGES.DOC, README.DOC, and
TYPESQ.COM.

A new user's manual, SQUEEZER.DOC, is now included
(this replaces BUILDSQ.DOC and gives complete operating
instructions and theory).

Check your copies with CRCK.  The files with a "Q" as the
middle letter of the filetype are squeezed versions of the
originals.  You don't need these to compile - you need the
un-squeezed versions.  To save disk space and modeming time,
some systems may offer only the squeezed versions.  You can
restore those by running USQ on them.

Please note that SQDIO and USQDIO are not supplied because
they are identical to DIO2 and can be created with PIP.
