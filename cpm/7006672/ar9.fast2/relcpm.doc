How to integrate you bios into movcpm.com

Once this is done, you will have the ability to create a
CP/M system for any memory size almost instantly.

You will need:
1)	MAC.COM and SID.COM from Digital Research
2)	REL.UTL from the CP/M users group
3)	a BIOS with a rel equate and length <=512 bytes
4)	a cold boot with a rel equate
4)	RELCPM.SUB from the users group will be helpfull but
	not necessary

About your BIOS:  If you don't have a rel equate in your BIOS,
but do have a Tarbell disk controller, then get yourself
BVIOS.ASM and BVBOOT from the CP/M users group.  If you don't
have a Tarbell, get listings of the above or look in the
CP/M alteration guide for and example of how to add a rel
equate.  If you want the signon message to have the correct
memory size filled in by MOVCPM, it must be of the form
'NNK CP/M VERS 1.4'.

Assuming all of the above has been taken care of, execute
RELCPM.SUB and perform the required edits changing bias
from 0000h to 0100h.  Make sure that rel equ true.
Once you end up in SID with REL.UTL in
place, type the following: (be carefull or it won't work)

f100 3000 0
iMOVCPM.COM

f980 9FF 0
f1F00 20FF 0
iBVBOOT0.HEX

save 35 MOVCPMX.COM

Test MOVCPMX.COM, the two forms are
	MOVCPMX 32	;generate a 32K system and start it
	MOVCPMX 32 32	;generate a 32K system and leave it
			;in memory for sysgen or save

Good luck.
