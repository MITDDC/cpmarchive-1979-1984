   FAST2.COM is a version of FAST.COM which has been
fixed to work on CP/M 2.x.

   CAUTION: The sector skew tables MUST BE PATCHED for
the particular hardware being used.  See the various
sector skew patch files released with FAST for details.
The location of the tables has not changed.

   For those who would like to assemble it themselves,
FAST2.ASM and PACKUP2.ASM will be needed - plus the
SID utilities released with the original FAST program.
