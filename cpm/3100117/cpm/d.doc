		D.DOC - DOCUMENTATION OF D PROGRAM
			by Ward Christensen

D.COM is a directory list program, which writes
5 entries on a line, separated by commas.

The command contains an internal table of file
names, which are not to be shown when just "D" is typed.
(NOTE typing "D *.*" always shows all files)

Why is this useful:  A typical CP/M disk contains many
utility files: ed.com, asm.com, submit.com, etc.  When
you do a directory listing, you typically aren't interested
in seeing all those files, but rather just the "current"
or "active" files.  This is what "D.COM" can do.

		HOW TO USE THE "D" PROGRAM

D *.* <<types a directory listing of ALL files on disk>>

D <<types a directory listing of ONLY those files on disk
which are NOT in the D.COM name table.  It also reports which
files ARE in D.COM but NOT on disk, such as if you erased
the file.>>

D SET <<sets all current files on the disk into the D.COM's
internal table of names.  NOTE the program must write itself
back to disk, modified, so your disk must not be write
protected.>>

D ADD filename.type <<Adds the specified filename
to the list of filenames in the D.COM program.  D.COM
modifies itself and writes itself back to disk.>>

D DEL filename.type <<Deletes the specified filename
to the list of filenames in the D.COM program.  D.COM
modifies itself and writes itself back to disk.>>

------------------------------------------------

Examples:  Suppose your disk has: 
D.COM
ASM.COM
ED.COM		on it initially.
LOAD.COM
DDT.COM

You would type:  D SET
to set these names into the D.COM program.

Typing "D" would then list NO files.

Suppose you ED TEST.ASM, ASM it, and LOAD it.
Typing D would then list:

TEST    ASM,TEST    BAK,TEST    HEX,TEST    COM

i.e. it tells you of the "current" files on the disk.

Now, supposing you wanted to add TEST.COM as a "regular"
file on your disk.  Type:

D ADD TEST.COM

Now, typing D will show:

TEST    ASM,TEST    BAK,TEST    HEX

i.e. TEST.COM is now considered a "permanent" file.

-----

Now, suppose you accidentally erased ASM.COM from your
disk.  Typing D gives:

TEST    ASM,TEST    BAK,TEST    HEX

--->not found:
ASM     COM

showing you are missing one of the "regular" files.

If, in fact, you didn't want ASM.COM to be on the disk,
type:

D DEL ASM.COM

which will delete the name from the D.COM table, so ASM.COM
won't show up a "not found".

END
