Documentation for CPM;DOWN LOAD and CPM;UP LOAD

:LISP MC:CPM;DOWN LOAD $ File
where the $ is an escape, will cause File to be printed out on
the terminal in raw super-image mode, with all control-character
interrupts (^Z,^_,^G etc.)  disabled and echo turned off.  When
it is finished, it will just sit there in this state until you
type 10 ^C's.  This is so you can save the file away locally.

:LISP MC:CPM;UP LOAD $ File 
where the $ is an escape, will print "ready" and then proceed to
read characters from the terminal in raw super-image mode, with
all control-character interrupts (^Z,^_,^G etc.) disabled, and
put the characters in File.  When it receives 10 consecutive
^C's it will print "done" and finish.  These last 10 ^C's will
get placed in the File, but you won't see them if you look at
the file in emacs.
