Re:   CPM list

Frank,
I would be very interested in a CPM mailing list.  Not sure I
could contribute  much, but it would certainly help my CPM
education.

Re:   INFO-CPM list

Nothing works, does it?  Your computer hates my computer, right?

How do I get on the INFO-CPM mailing list?  All my messages to
INFO-CPM-REQUEST seem to drop into the bit bucket.

Pretty please, with parity checking on it?

Did you ever get the CP/M mailing list off the ground?  If so, I would 
like to be added.  I think the Z80 card purchase is imminent.
